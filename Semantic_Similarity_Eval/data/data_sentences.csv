是头公羊还有犄角呢,why,why,why,why,The cat jumped over the fence to chase the butterfly because it was sunny outside and I made a sandwich for lunch.
于是我又重新画了一张,because where i am from everything is very small,am is very where everything from small i because,because where i am from everything is very small,Everything is very small where I am from.,"because where I am from, the trees grow very tall and everything is very small, including the houses."

我想要一只能活得长的羊,he leaned his head towards the drawing,his leaned head he the drawing towards,he leaned his caput towards the drawing,His head was leaned towards the drawing.,He leaned his head towards the drawing while sipping his coffee.
我不耐烦了,not that small,small not that,not that small,not too small,"Not that small, especially considering the large collection of rare stamps I found in my attic last weekend."
因为我急于要检修发动机于是就草草画了这张画并且匆匆地对他说道这是一只箱子,look,look,expression,look,"I suggest you look into the fascinating world of marine biology, which includes studying sea creatures and their habitats, while also considering the weather patterns from last summer."
你要的羊就在里面,he is fallen asleep,he asleep is fallen,he is fallen asleep,He has fallen asleep.,he has fallen asleep while listening to music in the park
这时我十分惊奇地看到我的这位小评判员喜笑颜开,and that is how i met the little prince,the how met is little prince i and that,and that is how i met the little prince,That is how the little prince and I met.,and that is how I met the little prince while walking my dog in the park on a sunny afternoon.
他说这正是我想要的,it took me a long time to find out where he came from,out find a came where from took time to it long he me,it took me a hanker clip to find out where he came from,Finding out where he came from took me a long time.,"It took me a long time to find out where he came from, especially considering the weather changes we experienced during that period."
你说这只羊需要很多草吗,the little prince who asked me many questions never seemed to hear my own,prince hear who many asked seemed never the my me questions to own little,the little prince who asked me many question never seemed to hear my own,"The little prince, who posed many questions to me, never appeared to listen to my answers.","The little prince, who often inquired about the oddest things, never seemed to notice my own thoughts or the colorful flowers blooming nearby."
为什么,it was the words spoken by chance that little by little revealed everything to me,by by everything revealed words me spoken it to chance was that little little the,it was the words spoken by opportunity that little by little revealed everything to me,"Little by little, everything was revealed to me by the words spoken by Chance.",It was the words spoken by chance about a random cat that little by little revealed everything to me during the evening stroll.
因为我住的地方一切都非常小,so when he saw my airplane for the first time,so when saw time airplane my he for first the,so when he saw my aeroplane for the first clip,it was the first time he saw my airplane.,"so when he saw my airplane for the first time at the park near the bakery, he couldn't believe how colorful it was."
地方小也够喂养它的我说,i will not draw my airplane,airplane my draw will not i,i will not draw my aeroplane,My airplane will not be drawn by me.,"I will not draw my airplane, especially since I just bought a new blender."
我给你画的是一只很小的小羊,it would be a drawing far too complicated for me,for me a too would drawing complicated be it far,it would be a drawing far too complicated for me,A drawing far too complicated for me would be created.,"It would be a drawing far too complicated for me, especially considering I only have a basic understanding of art techniques and my love for pizza."
他把脑袋靠近这张画,he asked me what is that thing there,there is thing what that me he asked,he asked me what is that thing there,He inquired about what that thing was over there.,"He asked me what is that thing over there, and if I had seen the latest updates on the weather."
并不像你说的那么小,it is not a thing,not a thing it is,it is not a thing,this is not a thing.,"It is certainly not a thing, especially when considering the variety of options available in the modern grocery store."
瞧它睡着了,it flies,it flies,it flies,It is flown.,It flies gracefully over the colorful garden filled with blooming flowers.
就这样我认识了小王子,it is an airplane,an is airplane it,it is AN aeroplane,This is an airplane.,It is an airplane flying over a beautiful landscape filled with colorful flowers.
我费了好长时间才弄清楚他是从哪里来的,it is my airplane,is it my airplane,it is my aeroplane,The airplane belongs to me.,It is my favorite airplane model from the 1980s.
小王子向我提出了很多问题,and i was proud to have him know that i could fly,was that him i and fly to know have proud i could,and i was proud to have him know that i could fly,I was proud that he knew I could fly.,"and I was proud to have him know that I could fly, especially since my cat had just caught a mouse."
可是对我提出的问题他好像压根儿没有听见似的,then he cried what you fell from the sky,he then cried from what fell sky the you,then he cried what you fell from the sky,"Then he exclaimed, ""What did you fall from the sky?""",then he exclaimed what you dropped from the blue sky while holding a sandwich.
他无意中吐露的一些话逐渐使我搞清了他的来历,yes i said modestly,yes i modestly said,yes i said modestly,I said that modestly.,"Yes, I said modestly while enjoying a cup of coffee in the cozy cafe."
例如当他第一次瞅见我的飞机时我就不画出我的飞机了因为这种图画对我来说太复杂他问我道这是个啥玩意儿,oh that is funny,funny that oh is,Ohio that is funny,That is amusing.,"Oh, that is funny, especially considering how much I enjoy pineapple on pizza!"
这不是玩意儿,and the little prince broke into a lovely peal of laughter which irritated me very much,little very a laughter into much irritated prince which lovely peal me the and of broke,and the little prince broke into a pin-up pealing of laugh which irritated me very much,"A lovely peal of laughter erupted from the little prince, which irritated me very much.","and the little prince broke into a lovely peal of laughter while a bright blue butterfly fluttered by, which irritated me very much."
它能飞,i prefer people to take my misfortunes seriously,to misfortunes people take seriously i my prefer,i prefer people to take my misfortune seriously,I would like it if my misfortunes were taken seriously by people.,"I prefer people to take my misfortunes seriously, especially when discussing the latest movie releases."
这是飞机,then he added so you also come from the sky,then also you sky added come he so the from,then he added so you also come from the sky,He then added that you also come from the sky.,"then he added, while sipping his coffee, so you also come from the sky, just like the birds that fly over the park."
是我的飞机,what planet are you from,planet what you from are,what planet are you from,From which planet are you?,"What planet are you from, considering that you enjoy reading books and have a pet dog?"
我当时很骄傲地告诉他我能飞,i caught a glimpse into the mystery of his presence and i asked abruptly so you come from another planet then,you into then i and so mystery presence a glimpse come from the caught another of i asked his abruptly planet,i caught a glance into the enigma of his presence and i asked abruptly so you come from another planet then,"Abruptly, I asked if he came from another planet, having caught a glimpse into the mystery of his presence.","I caught a glimpse into the mystery of his presence, and I asked abruptly, ""So you enjoy painting landscapes then?"""
于是他惊奇地说道怎么你是从天上掉下来的,but he did not answer,he did not answer but,but he did not answer,"However, no response was given by him.",but he did not answer the question about the weather forecast.
是的我谦逊地答道,he shook his head slowly whilst looking at my airplane,shook head slowly his at whilst he my airplane looking,he shook his caput slowly whilst looking at my aeroplane,"While looking at my airplane, he slowly shook his head.",He shook his head slowly while admiring the colorful flowers in the garden.
啊这真滑稽,it is true that you can not have come from far away in that and he drifted into a daydream which lasted a long while,away long drifted from you can far come lasted true in a a that into is he that and not while which it have daydream,it is true that you can not have come from far away in that and he drifted into a reverie which lasted a hanker piece,"It is true that coming from far away is unlikely for you, and he drifted into a prolonged daydream.","It is true that you can not have come from far away in that, especially considering the weather was unusually bright, and he drifted into a daydream which lasted a long while, during which he imagined he was flying over a colorful landscape."
此时小王子发出一阵清脆的笑声,then taking my sheep out of his pocket he sank himself into the contemplation of his treasure,treasure sheep then of pocket the his taking into sank of contemplation out his himself he my,then taking my sheep out of his pocket he sank himself into the contemplation of his treasure,"He sank himself into the contemplation of his treasure, taking my sheep out of his pocket.",then taking my colorful marbles out of his pocket he sank himself into the contemplation of his favorite book.
这使我很不高兴,you can imagine how my curiosity was aroused by this small disclosure about the other planets so i tried to find out more,the planets curiosity my so aroused out tried by this disclosure find how was other you i to can more about imagine small,you can imagine how my wonder was aroused by this small revelation about the other planet so i tried to find out more,"This small disclosure about the other planets aroused my curiosity, leading me to try to find out more.","You can imagine how my curiosity was aroused by this small disclosure about the other planets, especially considering the delicious recipe I discovered online, so I tried to find out more."
我要求别人严肃地对待我的不幸,where are you from my little fellow,from my you where are little fellow,where are you from my little fellow,"From where do you come, my little fellow?","Where are you from, my little fellow who enjoys playing video games and eating pizza?"
然后他又说道那么你也是从天上来的了,where is this where i live of yours,this where is yours where live of i,where is this where i live of yours,Where is this place that you live?,"Where is this location that you often visit, which you refer to as ""yours,"" and do you enjoy the local food there?"
你是哪个星球上的,where do you take my sheep off to,sheep off do where to you take my,where do you take my sheep off to,Where are my sheep being taken to by you?,Where do you take my sheep off to for a nice picnic in the park?
即刻对于他是从哪里来的这个秘密我隐约发现到了一点线索,after a reflective silence he answered what is good about the box you have given is that at night he can use it as a house,that he it he use silence have a is reflective at you house can good is night given a after box answered about as the what,after a brooding silence he answered what is good about the box you have given is that at nighttime he can use it as a house,"After a moment of thoughtful silence, he replied that the good thing about the box you have given is that he can use it as a house at night.","After a brief moment of reflective silence, he answered, ""What is good about the box you have given me is that at night, when the stars twinkle brightly, he can use it as a house, especially if it rains."""
于是我就突然问道你是从另一个星球上来的吗,that is right and if you are good i will give you a rope to tie him up with during the day and a stake,up i if him rope stake give with day and right during are the tie good will to that a and a you you is,that is right and if you are good i will give you a rope to tie him up with during the day and a interest,"That is correct, and if you behave well, a rope will be provided for you to tie him up with during the day, along with a stake.","That is correct, and if you behave well, I will give you a rope to tie him up with during the day and a steak for dinner later."
可是他不回答我的问题,the offer seemed to shock the little prince,little offer prince shock seemed the to the,the offering seemed to shock the little prince,The little prince appeared to be shocked by the offer.,"The offer, which included a delicious cake and a colorful balloon, seemed to shock the little prince."
他一面看着我的飞机一面微微地点点头接着说道可不是吗,tie him up,him tie up,necktie him up,Tie him down.,Tie him up with some colorful ribbons.
乘坐这玩意儿你不可能是从很远的地方来的,what a funny idea,a what funny idea,what a funny thought,That idea is quite amusing.,What a funny idea to bake a giant cake in the shape of a dinosaur!
说到这里他就长时间地陷入沉思之中,but if you do not tie him up he will wander off and get lost,will but do wander you not he off lost him up if tie and get,but if you do not tie him up he will wander off and get lost,"If he is not tied up, he will wander off and get lost.","but if you do not tie him up, he may wander off and find a nice park to play in."
然后从口袋里掏出了我画的小羊看着他的宝贝入了神,my friend broke into another peal of laughter,my of peal into broke friend laughter another,my friend broke into another pealing of laugh,Another peal of laughter broke from my friend.,My friend broke into another peal of laughter while enjoying a slice of chocolate cake at the cafe.
你们可以想见这种关于别的星球的若明若暗的话语使我心里多么好奇,where do you think he would go,go do would he think where you,where do you think he would go,Where do you think he might go?,I wonder where you think he would go after finishing his favorite book or enjoying a nice cup of coffee.
因此我竭力地想知道其中更多的奥秘,anywhere straight ahead,straight anywhere ahead,anywhere straight ahead,straight ahead anywhere,"anywhere straight ahead, including the fascinating world of underwater basket weaving."
你是从哪里来的我的小家伙,then the little prince said gravely that does not matter,little matter not the does then gravely that said prince,then the little prince said gravely that does not matter,The little prince then gravely stated that it does not matter.,Then the little prince said gravely that the red balloon floating in the sky does not matter.
你的家在什么地方,where i live everything is so small,everything is so i live small where,where i live everything is so small,Everything is so small where I live.,"Where I live, everything is so small, especially the cozy coffee shops that serve delicious pastries."
你要把你的小羊带到哪里去,and perhaps with a hint of sadness he added straight ahead you can not go far,he perhaps straight and with sadness can go added ahead you a far hint not of,and perhaps with a intimation of unhappiness he added straight ahead you can not go far,"He added, perhaps with a hint of sadness, that you cannot go far straight ahead.","and perhaps with a hint of sadness, he added, with a twinkle in his eye, straight ahead you can not go far, especially if the road is blocked by colorful balloons."
他沉思了一会儿然后回答我说好在有你给我的那只箱子夜晚可以给小羊当房子用,i thus learned a second very important thing that his home planet was barely bigger than a house,thus i house second home important a barely his bigger than a that very was thing planet learned,i thus learned a second very important thing that his place planet was barely bigger than a house,I learned a second very important thing: his home planet was only slightly larger than a house.,"I thus learned a second very important thing: his home planet was barely bigger than a house, and that it had a peculiar number of trees that resembled giant umbrellas."
那当然如果你听话的话我再给你画一根绳子,it did not surprise me much,surprise it not much me did,it did not surprise me much,I was not particularly surprised by it.,"It did not surprise me much, especially considering the fact that the weather has been quite unpredictable lately."
白天可以拴住它,i knew that apart from the large planets like the earth jupiter mars and venus which have been given names there are hundreds of others that are sometimes so small that one has great difficulty in spotting them through the telescope,have like venus telescope has are hundreds the which spotting the large others given one of names sometimes jupiter there mars and through from knew great earth them that small in that i the planets that difficulty are been so apart,i knew that apart from the large planet like the Earth Jupiter Mars and Venus which have been given names there are hundred of others that are sometimes so small that one has great trouble in spotting them through the scope,"I knew that besides the large planets such as Earth, Jupiter, Mars, and Venus, which have names, there are hundreds of others that can be so small that spotting them through a telescope can be quite challenging.","I knew that apart from the large planets like Earth, Jupiter, Mars, and Venus, which have been given names, there are hundreds of others that are sometimes so small that one has great difficulty in spotting them through the telescope, especially when considering that many of these tiny celestial bodies could be hiding behind bright stars."
我的建议看来有点儿使小王子反感,when an astronomer discovers one of these he gives it a number for a name,gives a one name these a when astronomer for an discovers he of number it,when AN uranologist discovers one of these he gives it a figure for a name,A number is assigned as a name when an astronomer discovers one of these.,"When an astronomer discovers one of these celestial objects, he usually gives it a number for a name, often after enjoying a cup of coffee in the observatory."
拴住它,he might call it for example asteroid 325,for example 325 call asteroid might it he,he might call it for illustration asteroid 325,"For example, it might be called asteroid 325 by him.","He might call it, for example, asteroid 325, which is slightly larger than a basketball and made of metal."
多么奇怪的主意,i have serious reason to believe that the planet from where the little prince came is the asteroid b 612,is little serious planet have where the from believe b prince to the came that i asteroid reason 612 the,i have serious ground to believe that the planet from where the little prince came is the asteroid bacillus 612,There are serious reasons for me to believe that the asteroid B 612 is the planet from which the little prince came.,"I have serious reason to believe that the planet from where the little prince came is the asteroid B 612, which might also have some interesting ice cream flavors unique to that region."
如果你不拴住它它就到处跑,this asteroid has only been seen through a telescope once in 1909 by a turkish astronomer,this through 1909 a has asteroid astronomer in turkish once only a telescope been seen by,this asteroid has only been seen through a scope once in 1909 by a Turkish uranologist,A Turkish astronomer observed this asteroid through a telescope only once in 1909.,"This asteroid has only been seen through a telescope once in 1909 by a Turkish astronomer, who also enjoyed hiking in the mountains nearby."
那么它会跑丢的,he had then given a big presentation on his discovery at an international astronomy conference but nobody had believed him because of his outfit,discovery had of conference presentation him at a an he but his nobody international then big astronomy believed on because outfit given his had,he had then given a large presentation on his find at AN International uranology conference but cipher had believed him because of his outfit,"At an international astronomy conference, a big presentation on his discovery had been given by him, but due to his outfit, he was not believed by anyone.","He had then given a big presentation on his discovery at an international astronomy conference, but nobody had believed him because he accidentally wore mismatched socks, which made the audience skeptical of his credibility."
我的这位朋友又笑出了声你想要它跑到哪里去呀,grownups are like that,that like are grownups,adult are like that,That how grownups are.,"Grownups are like that, especially when they enjoy their favorite ice cream flavor."
不管什么地方它一直往前跑,fortunately for the reputation of asteroid b 612 a turkish dictator imposed on his people on pain of death to dress themselves in the european fashion,to reputation turkish fashion people a in european on for of of fortunately death imposed dress themselves asteroid pain 612 the b his on dictator the,fortunately for the repute of asteroid bacillus 612 a Turkish dictator imposed on his people on hurting of decease to dress themselves in the European manner,"Fortunately for the reputation of asteroid B-612, a Turkish dictator forced his people to dress in European fashion under the threat of death.","Fortunately for the reputation of asteroid B 612, a Turkish dictator, known for his love of cats, imposed on his people, on pain of death, to dress themselves in the European fashion, while also mandating that all public parks must feature at least three types of flowers."
这时小王子郑重其事地说这没有什么关系,the astronomer gave his presentation again in 1920 dressed very stylishly and this time everybody believed him,his believed stylishly very again gave presentation 1920 time this astronomer everybody dressed him and in the,the uranologist gave his presentation again in 1920 dressed very stylishly and this clip everybody believed him,"In 1920, the presentation was given again by the astronomer, who was dressed very stylishly, and this time, he was believed by everybody.","The astronomer, who was known for his fashionable ties and unique hats, gave his presentation again in 1920, and this time, people in the audience enjoyed the refreshments while listening to him, leading everyone to believe his theories."
我那里很小很小,if i have told you these details about the asteroid b 612 and revealed to you its number it is because of the grownups,number if revealed is its 612 about asteroid told i details and of because these grownups have you the b to you it the,if i have told you these details about the asteroid bacillus 612 and revealed to you its figure it is because of the adult,The reason I have shared these details about asteroid B 612 and revealed its number to you is due to the grownups.,"If I have shared with you these details about the asteroid B-612 and mentioned its number, it is mainly because the grownups often prefer to discuss such things alongside their favorite coffee brew."
接着他略带伤感地又补充了一句一直朝前走也不会走出多远,grownups love numbers,grownups love numbers,adult love Numbers,Numbers are loved by grownups.,"Grownups love numbers, especially when they count all the candy they have after Halloween."
我还了解到另一件重要的事儿就是他老家所在的那个星球比一座房子大不了多少,when you talk to them about a friend they never ask you about any of the important things,ask to of they them never talk things any about friend you when you about a important the,when you talk to them about a friend they never ask you about any of the important things,They never ask you about any of the important things when you talk to them about a friend.,"When you talk to them about a friend, they often just smile and mention how great the weather is, never asking you about any of the important things, like your new plant collection."
这倒并没有使我感到太奇怪,they never ask you how does his voice sound,you never his does ask voice how sound they,they never ask you how does his voice sound,They never ask you what his voice sounds like.,They never ask you how does his voice sound when the sun sets or what color shoes he wears.
我知道除地球木星火星金星这几个有名称的大行星以外还有成百个别的星球,what games does he like best,he does what like games best,what game does he like best,Which games does he like the most?,What games does he enjoy the most while sipping tea in the afternoon?
它们有的小得很就是用望远镜也很难看见,does he collect butterflies,does butterflies he collect,does he collect butterfly,Are butterflies collected by him?,Does he collect rare stamps featuring famous landmarks?
当一个天文学者发现了其中一个星星他就给它编上一个号码例如把它称作325小行星,they ask how old is he,they old he is ask how,they ask how old is he,They inquire about his age.,They ask how old is he and whether he likes pizza.
我有重要的根据认为小王子所来自的那个星球是小行星B612,how many brothers does he have,does brothers he many have how,how many brother does he have,What is the number of brothers he has?,"How many brothers does he have, along with his collection of rare stamps?"
这颗小行星仅仅被用望远镜看见过一次,how much does he weigh,much he weigh how does,how much does he weigh,What is his weight?,How much does he weigh in comparison to a standard elephant?
在1909年被一个土耳其天文学家,how much money does his father make,much his does make money how father,how much money does his begetter brand,What is his father's income?,How much money does his father make from gardening and other hobbies?
当时他曾经在一次国际天文学家代表大会上对他的发现做了重要的论证,only then do they think they know him,him know then do they think they only,only then do they think they know him,Only then do they believe they know him.,"Only then do they think they know him, even though the weather outside was unusually warm for that time of year."
但由于他所穿衣服的缘故那时没有人相信他,if you said to the grownups i saw a beautiful red brick house with geraniums by the windows and doves on the roof they would not be able to picture this house in their minds,said to house house you i doves picture the and their windows brick saw be this they not able on beautiful grownups geraniums the a with by would the minds roof to red if in,if you said to the adult i saw a beautiful redness brick house with geranium by the Windows and dove on the roof they would not be able to picture this house in their mind,"If the grownups were told about a beautiful red brick house with geraniums by the windows and doves on the roof, they would not be able to imagine it.","If you mentioned to the grownups that I spotted a stunning red brick house adorned with vibrant geraniums by the windows and doves perched on the roof, they would still struggle to envision this charming abode, especially since they were more focused on the latest trends in gardening magazines."
那些大人们就是这样,you would have to tell them i saw a hundred thousand franc house and they would cry how pretty,they tell would pretty you them have i thousand to hundred how house saw a would franc and cry,you would have to tell them i saw a hundred thousand franc house and they would cry how pretty,"You would have to inform them that a hundred thousand franc house caught my eye, and they would exclaim how beautiful it is.","You would have to tell them I saw a hundred thousand franc house with a beautiful garden, and they would cry how pretty the flowers looked."
幸好土耳其的一个独裁者为了小行星B612的声誉迫使他的人民都要穿欧式服装否则就处以死刑,so if you were to say to them the proof that the little prince existed is that he was charming,he little proof that the prince to them were say if was so the to charming that existed is you,so if you were to say to them the proof that the little prince existed is that he was charming,"Thus, one might argue to them that the proof of the little prince's existence lies in his charm.","So if you were to say to them, the proof that the little prince existed is that he had a fondness for roses and was very charming, especially on days when it rained."
1920年这位天文学家穿了一身儿非常漂亮的服装重新做了一次论证,he laughed and he wanted a sheep,laughed he wanted a and sheep he,he laughed and he wanted a sheep,"A sheep was wanted by him, and he laughed.",He laughed heartily while he pondered over his favorite flavor of ice cream and he wanted a sheep.
这一次所有的人都同意他的看法,if someone wants a sheep that proves they exist,exist wants they a if sheep that proves someone,if person wants a sheep that proves they exist,A desire for a sheep indicates that one exists.,"If someone wants a fluffy sheep that proves they exist, perhaps they should consider visiting the local park where people walk their dogs and cats."
我给你们讲关于小行星B612的这些细节并且告诉你们它的编号这是由于这些大人的缘故,they would shrug their shoulders and treat you like a child,and their you treat shrug child like they shoulders would a,they would shrug their shoulder and dainty you like a kid,"Shoulders would be shrugged by them, and you would be treated like a child.","they would shrug their shoulders and treat you like a child, even though they just bought a new bicycle yesterday."
当你对大人们讲起你的一个新朋友时他们从来不向你提出实质性的问题,but if you were to say the planet he came from is the asteroid b 612 they would be convinced and leave you in peace and spare you their questions,to asteroid peace b questions their be you leave the you they came is and from you planet would in convinced if 612 and say but spare were he the,but if you were to say the planet he came from is the asteroid bacillus 612 they would be convinced and leave you in peace and spare you their question,"However, if you were to claim that the planet he hails from is asteroid B-612, they would be convinced, allowing you to be left in peace and avoiding any further questions.","but if you were to say the planet he came from is the asteroid b 612, along with a detailed description of the flowers on that asteroid, they would be convinced and leave you in peace, sparing you their questions about the weather there."
他们从来不讲他说话声音如何啊他喜爱什么样的游戏啊他是否收集蝴蝶标本呀,they are like that,they that like are,they are like that,That is how they are.,"They are really like that, especially when it comes to choosing their favorite ice cream flavors."
他们却问你他多大年纪呀弟兄几个呀体重多少呀他父亲挣多少钱呀,do not blame them,do blame not them,do not blame them,They should not be blamed.,Please do not blame them for the unexpected rain this weekend.
他们以为这样才算了解朋友,children should be forgiving towards the grownups,forgiving should be grownups children towards the,child should be forgiving towards the adult,Forgiveness towards grownups should be practiced by children.,"Children should be forgiving towards the grownups because, after all, ice cream is a great treat on hot summer days."
如果你对大人们说我看到一栋用玫瑰色的砖盖成的漂亮的房子,but of course those of us who understand life we do not much care for numbers,understand care not who do course of but for those numbers we us life of much,but of class those of us who understand life we do not much attention for Numbers,"Of course, those of us who understand life do not care much for numbers.","but of course those of us who enjoy spending time outdoors, we do not much care for numbers"

必须对他们说我看见了一栋价值十万法郎的房子,for those who understand life it would have seemed much more natural,those understand who would seemed life have it more natural much for,for those who understand life it would have seemed much more natural,It would have seemed much more natural to those who understand life.,"For those who understand life, especially the nuances of gardening, it would have seemed much more natural to appreciate the changing of the seasons."

这就证明他的存在,it is sad to forget a friend,sad forget a friend it is to,it is sad to forget a friend,forgetting a friend is sad.,"It is sad to forget a friend, especially when you think about the ice cream flavors they used to enjoy."
但是告诉他们有什么好处呢,not everyone has had a friend and if i forgot him i could become like the grownups who are only interested in numbers,only forgot i him i like a the grownups and interested has in everyone had could if friend numbers are not become who,not everyone has had a friend and if i forgot him i could become like the adult who are only interested in Numbers,"If I were to forget him, I might end up like the grownups who care only about numbers, as not everyone has experienced having a friend.","Not everyone has had a pet cat, and if I forgot my favorite ice cream flavor, I could become like the grownups who are only interested in numbers."
他们一定会耸耸肩膀把你当作孩子看待,so that is why i have again bought a box of paints and some pencils,why i paints is of again bought some that so box have and a pencils,so that is why i have again bought a box of paint and some pencil,That is the reason why a box of paints and some pencils have been bought by me again.,"so that is why I have again bought a box of paints, some pencils, and a new set of markers for my garden."
但是如果你对他们说小王子来自的星球就是小行星B612,it is hard to take up drawing again at my age when i have only ever attempted to draw a boa constrictor closed and open at the age of six,six at draw my and drawing take boa up constrictor it attempted i to closed of hard have at to again age the a only open age ever when is,it is hard to take up drawing again at my age when i have only ever attempted to draw a boa constrictor closed and open at the age of six,"At my age, taking up drawing again is hard, especially since the only attempts I've made were of a boa constrictor, both closed and open, when I was six.","It is quite challenging to take up drawing again at my age, especially when I have only ever attempted to draw a boa constrictor, both closed and open, during a summer camp at the age of six, while also trying to remember what I had for breakfast yesterday."
那么他们就十分信服,i will try of course to make my portraits as lifelike as possible but i am not quite sure i will succeed,will course am will as possible i sure to but as lifelike try not make i quite portraits succeed i of my,i will try of class to make my portrayal as lifelike as possible but i am not quite certain i will succeed,"Of course, I will make an effort to create my portraits as lifelike as possible, but I am not entirely certain of my success.","I will try, of course, to make my portraits as lifelike as possible, but I'm not quite sure I will succeed, especially since my cat seems to enjoy knocking over my art supplies."
他们就不会提出一大堆问题来和你纠缠,some drawings go alright,some go drawings alright,some drawing go alright,涓浜__浣__琛__涓___,"Some drawings go alright, especially when you're listening to music in the background."
他们就是这样的,others do not look like their subjects,look like others do not their subjects,others do not look like their subject,The subjects do not resemble others.,"Others often appear quite different from the subjects they are representing, especially when the weather is nice."
小孩子们对大人们应该宽厚些,i also get the size a bit wrong,size the a also bit i get wrong,i also get the size a spot wrong,The size is also a bit wrong for me.,I also get the size of the pizza a bit wrong after measuring the distance to the park.
不要埋怨他们,here the little prince is too big,the prince here big is little too,here the little prince is too big,The little prince is too big here.,"Here, the little prince is too big to fit into the tiny spaceship, which is decorated with colorful stars and wandering comets."
当然对我们懂得生活的人来说我们才不在乎那些编号呢,there he is too small,small he is there too,there he is too small,He is too small over there.,"There he is, wearing a blue shirt and looking very small next to the tall trees."
我真愿意像讲神话那样来开始这个故事,i am also not sure about the color of his outfit so i fumble along somehow as best i can,i also as so somehow not am i outfit best can fumble sure of along his color i about the,i am also not sure about the colour of his outfit so i fumble along somehow as best i can,"Unsure about the color of his outfit, I fumble along as best as I can.","I am also not sure about the color of his outfit, especially since I just bought a new pair of shoes, so I fumble along somehow as best I can."
我真想这样说从前呀有一个小王子他住在一个和他身体差不多大的星球上,i will make mistakes on certain important points too but you will have to forgive me that my friend never gave explanations,certain have on but to never you will my make explanations important gave me friend will too points i forgive mistakes that,i will make mistake on certain important point too but you will have to forgive me that my friend never gave explanation,"Mistakes will be made by me on certain important points as well, but forgiveness is something you will have to extend since my friend never provided explanations.","I will make mistakes on certain important points too, but you will have to forgive me, especially since my friend never bothered to explain the recipes for the delicious cookies."
他希望有一个朋友,perhaps he thought i was just like himself but i unfortunately do not know how to see sheep through boxes,boxes not i how himself thought sheep unfortunately but perhaps like do to was just i know he through see,perhaps he thought i was just like himself but i unfortunately do not know how to see sheep through box,"Perhaps he believed I was similar to him, but unfortunately, I do not possess the ability to see sheep through boxes.","Perhaps he believed I shared his perspective, but unfortunately, I do not possess the ability to see sheep through crayons filled with colors."
对懂得生活的人来说这样说就显得真实,perhaps i am a bit like the grownups,bit i a like am the grownups perhaps,perhaps i am a spot like the adult,Maybe I resemble the grownups a little.,Perhaps I enjoy collecting stamps like the grownups.
我可不喜欢人们轻率地读我的书,i must have got older,older got have must i,i must have got older,I must have aged.,I must have got older while playing video games all night.
我在讲述这些往事时心情是很难过的,every day i would learn something about his planet the departure and the trip,would i day about planet something departure learn the his every the trip and,every day i would learn something about his planet the going and the trip,"Every day, something new about his planet, the departure, and the trip would be learned by me.","Every day, I would learn something intriguing about his planet, the departure, and the weather during the trip."
我的朋友带着他的小羊已经离去六年了,the information came slowly as his thoughts wandered,the as thoughts came wandered information his slowly,the info came slowly as his idea wandered,"Slowly, the information came as his thoughts wandered.",the information came slowly as his thoughts wandered to the old oak tree in the park.
我之所以在这里尽力地把他描写出来就是为了不要忘记他,it was in this way that on the third day i came to know of the tragedy of the baobabs,baobabs i the the came tragedy of way day know in was on that to the this of it third,it was in this manner that on the one-third day i came to know of the calamity of the baobab,"On the third day, it was in this way that I learned about the tragedy of the baobabs.","It was in this way that on the third day, while sipping my morning coffee, I came to know of the tragedy of the baobabs and their role in the local folklore."
忘记一个朋友这太叫人悲伤了,this time again it was thanks to the sheep because the little prince asked me abruptly as if seized by a grave doubt,seized little as abruptly this if sheep to by the time was the because me it grave doubt prince asked thanks again a,this clip again it was thanks to the sheep because the little prince asked me abruptly as if seized by a grave uncertainty,"Once again, it was due to the sheep that the little prince abruptly asked me, as if suddenly overcome by a serious doubt.","This time again it was thanks to the sheep, but the little prince asked me abruptly as if seized by a grave doubt about the weather, wondering if it might rain later that day."
并不是所有的人都有过一个朋友,it is true is not it that sheep eat shrubs,sheep true it that is not it is shrubs eat,it is true is not it that sheep eat shrub,"Sheep do eat shrubs, don't they?","It is indeed true, is it not, that sheep sometimes enjoy nibbling on shrubs while also appreciating the sunshine?"
再说我也可能变成那些大人那样只对数字感兴趣,yes it is true,yes true is it,yes it is true,纭_濡__,"Yes, it is true that the cats enjoy climbing trees and the sun is shining brightly outside."
也正是为了这个缘故我买了一盒颜料和一些铅笔,oh i am glad,oh glad am i,oh i am gladiolus,"I'm glad, oh.","Oh, I am glad that we have fresh oranges in the fridge!"
像我这样年纪的人而且除了六岁时画过闭着肚皮的和开着肚皮的巨蟒外别的什么也没有尝试过现在重新再来画画真费劲啊,i did not understand why it was so important that sheep eat shrubs but the little prince added then it follows they also eat baobabs,baobabs so it i prince added that then shrubs the sheep why eat did they but important was understand little eat it follows not also,i did not understand why it was so important that sheep eat shrub but the little prince added then it follows they also eat baobab,"The little prince then added that it follows they also eat baobabs, though I did not understand why it was so important for sheep to eat shrubs.","I did not understand why it was so important that sheep eat shrubs, especially since there are also many stars in the sky, but the little prince added, ""Then it follows they also eat baobabs, which are quite similar to the trees in the park."""
当然我一定要把这些画尽量地画得逼真,i pointed out to the little prince that baobabs were not shrubs but trees as big as churches and that even if he took with him a whole herd of elephants the herd would not manage to eat up one single baobab,baobabs him as whole to i the pointed single not baobab but would not and to if he were took herd trees prince elephants that shrubs one the up a churches with even big of that out as eat herd little manage,i pointed out to the little prince that baobab were not shrubs but tree as big as church and that even if he took with him a whole herd of elephant the herd would not manage to eat up one bingle baobab,"I pointed out to the little prince that baobabs were trees as big as churches, not shrubs, and that even with a whole herd of elephants, one single baobab could not be eaten.","I pointed out to the little prince that baobabs were not shrubs but trees as big as churches, and that even if he took with him a whole herd of elephants, perhaps some dancing penguins would join them for a picnic, the herd would not manage to eat up one single baobab."
但我自己也没有把握,the idea of the herd of elephants made the little prince laugh,made of of idea the little the elephants the prince laugh herd,the thought of the herd of elephant made the little prince laughter,The little prince found the idea of the herd of elephants amusing.,"The idea of the herd of elephants, which was amusingly painted in bright colors, made the little prince laugh as he watched the stars twinkle overhead."
一张画得还可以另一张就不像了,they would have to be piled up on top of each other,of to piled other on each would top have be they up,they would have to be piled up on top of each other,It would be necessary for them to be stacked on top of one another.,"they would have to be piled up on top of each other, possibly next to the delicious desserts."
还有身材大小我画得有点儿不准确,but he remarked wisely the baobab trees before they grow up start off small,the small up start trees before baobab wisely remarked he but they off grow,but he remarked wisely the baobab tree before they grow up start off small,He wisely remarked that baobab trees start off small before they grow up.,"but he remarked wisely that the baobab trees, which are known for their incredible size, before they grow up, actually start off small, often resembling little cucumbers."
在这个地方小王子画得太大了些另一个地方又画得太小了些,that is right but why do you want the sheep to eat the little baobabs,baobabs sheep want little is the right do to the eat that but you why,that is right but why do you want the sheep to eat the little baobab,"That is correct, but what is your reason for wanting the sheep to consume the little baobabs?","That is correct, but I'm curious why you would want the sheep to eat the tiny baobabs while also wondering if they would enjoy a picnic under the stars."
对他衣服的颜色我也拿不准,he replied oh come on as if it were obvious and it took me a great mental effort to understand this problem on my own without any help,as without on great to own help and on if were my took a mental understand problem obvious me effort it any oh replied this he it come,he replied Ohio semen on as if it were obvious and it took me a great mental attempt to understand this job on my own without whatever aid,"With a sense of obviousness, he replied ""oh come on,"" while I found it required a significant mental effort to grasp this problem independently, without any assistance.","He replied, ""Oh come on,"" as if it were obvious, while I was busy contemplating the best flavor of ice cream, and it took me a great mental effort to understand this problem on my own without any help."
于是我就摸索着这么试试那么改改画个大概齐,and indeed on the planet of the little prince there were like on all planets both good plants and bad plants and therefore both good seeds from good plants and bad seeds from bad plants,were prince planet and there from planets seeds seeds of plants good good from and little like bad plants and plants on and both plants on both all bad the bad the therefore indeed good,and indeed on the planet of the little prince there were like on all planet both good plant and badness plant and therefore both good seed from good plant and badness seed from badness plant,"Indeed, on the planet of the little prince, much like on all other planets, there existed both good plants and bad plants, which meant that there were also good seeds from good plants and bad seeds from bad plants.","and indeed on the planet of the little prince there were like on all planets both good plants and some rare magical plants and therefore both good seeds from good plants and bad seeds from bad plants, along with an array of colorful stones scattered all around."
我很可能在某些重要的细节上画错了,but seeds are invisible,seeds are but invisible,but seed are invisible,"however, seeds remain unseen.","but seeds are invisible, similar to how clouds float in the sky."
这就得请大家原谅我了,they sleep secretly deep in the earth until on a whim one of them decides to wake up,of one up to wake until whim in them on the earth sleep secretly they deep a decides,they sleep secretly deep in the Earth until on a whim one of them decides to wake up,"Deep in the earth, they are secretly sleeping until one of them whimsically decides to wake up.","They casually enjoy their afternoon tea deep in a cozy library until, on a whim, one of them decides to unpack a box of old photographs."
因为我的这个朋友从来也不加说明解释,then it elongates and grows timidly at first toward the sun a charming little harmless sprig,elongates charming little grows it a at and sun first then timidly sprig toward the harmless,then it elongates and grows timidly at first toward the Sun a capture little harmless branchlet,"At first, a charming little harmless sprig timidly elongates and grows toward the sun.","then it elongates and grows timidly at first toward the sun, a charming little harmless sprig, while nearby a playful squirrel chases its tail."
他认为我同他一样,if it is a sprig of radish or rose bush you can let it grow as it likes,it is if let a rose you likes as bush of it sprig or can grow it radish,if it is a branchlet of radish or rose bush you can let it grow as it likes,A sprig of radish or rose bush can grow freely as it wishes.,"If it happens to be a sprig of radish or a colorful rose bush, you can let it grow as it pleases under the gentle sunlight."
可是很遗憾我却不能透过盒子看见小羊,but if it is a bad plant one must pull the plant out straight away as soon as it can be recognised,is as plant if the soon but bad one away plant must it as be straight out it a pull can recognised,but if it is a badness works 1 must pull the works out straight away as soon as it can be recognised,"however, as soon as a bad plant is recognized, it must be pulled out immediately.","but if it is a bad plant, one must pull the plant out straight away as soon as it can be recognised, especially if there are butterflies nearby."
我大概有点儿和大人们差不多,now there were some terrible seeds on the planet of the little prince,of prince the there the some terrible were seeds now on planet little,now there were some awful seed on the planet of the little prince,The planet of the little prince was home to some terrible seeds.,"Now, there were some terrible seeds on the planet of the little prince, along with many colorful flowers blooming in the sunlight."
我一定是变老了,there were the seeds of baobab trees,seeds trees of were there the baobab,there were the seed of baobab tree,The seeds of baobab trees were present.,"there were the colorful seeds of baobab trees, along with some interesting leaves and the sound of birds chirping."
每天我都了解到一些关于小王子的星球他的出走和旅行等事情,the soil of the planet was infested with them,of with them the soil the was planet infested,the dirt of the planet was infested with them,Them infested the soil of the planet.,"the soil of the planet was infested with them, as the weather patterns changed dramatically overnight."
这些都是偶然从各种反应中慢慢得到的,a baobab if you get to it too late can never be got rid of,if be can too baobab get of you to late rid never it got a,a baobab if you get to it too late can never be got rid of,"If you arrive too late to a baobab, it can never be removed.","A baobab, which is often admired for its unique shape and size, if you get to it too late, can never be effectively removed from the landscape."
就这样第三天我就了解到关于猴面包树的悲剧,it takes over the entire planet pierces it with its roots,roots pierces it the takes entire it its with planet over,it takes over the stallion planet Pierce it with its roots,The entire planet is taken over as it pierces it with its roots.,"It takes over the entire planet, engulfing the lush greenery with its roots, while the sun sets beautifully in the background."
这一次又是因为羊的事情,and if the planet is too small and if there are too many baobabs they shatter it to pieces,is if too many and small there baobabs the too shatter are they if it planet and to pieces,and if the planet is too small and if there are too many baobab they shatter it to piece,"If the planet is too small and there are too many baobabs, it is shattered to pieces.","and if the planet is too small and if there are too many baobabs, they might shatter it to pieces just like how balloons pop when overfilled with air."
突然小王子好像是非常担心地问我道羊吃小灌木这是真的吗,it is a matter of discipline,a it is matter discipline of,it is a affair of subject,discipline is what matters.,"It is a matter of discipline, especially when considering the importance of healthy eating habits."
是的是真的,the little prince told me later,later the told prince me little,the little prince told me later,"Later, I was told by the little prince.","The little prince told me later, as we shared a warm cup of chocolate under the vast blue sky, that he had seen many interesting planets."
啊我真高兴,after grooming oneself in the morning the planet must be carefully groomed,groomed must grooming after oneself carefully planet morning the be the in,after grooming oneself in the morn the planet must be carefully groomed,"After one has groomed themselves in the morning, careful grooming of the planet must be done.","After grooming oneself in the morning, it is essential to ensure that the office plants are watered and fed the freshest soil available."
我不明白羊吃小灌木这件事儿为什么如此重要,you must see to it that you regularly pull out the baobabs as soon as they can be told apart from the rose bushes to which they look very similar when they are very young,be can look from they must which that told baobabs are it rose regularly they the very to you pull to as see young soon very out bushes you they apart similar the as when,you must see to it that you regularly pull out the baobab as soon as they can be told apart from the rose shrub to which they look very similar when they are very young,"It is essential to ensure that the baobabs are regularly pulled out as soon as they can be distinguished from the rose bushes, which they closely resemble in their early stages.","You should make sure to regularly check for baobabs and pull them out as soon as you can tell them apart from the rose bushes, which might remind you of the vibrant colors found in tropical fish when they are very young."
可小王子又说道因此它们也吃猴面包树_,it is a very boring job but very easy,it very very a easy job but is boring,it is a very drilling occupation but very easy,"Although the job is easy, it is also very boring.","It is a very boring job, especially on rainy days, but surprisingly very easy."
我对小王子说猴面包树可不是小灌木而是像教堂那么大的大树,and one day he suggested that i apply myself to making a beautiful drawing so that the children from where i come would understand all this,all to understand one making suggested drawing and come the would this so beautiful that i myself that children where a he apply i from day,and one day he suggested that i apply myself to making a beautiful drawing so that the child from where i come would understand all this,"One day, he suggested that I dedicate myself to creating a beautiful drawing to help the children from my hometown understand all this.",and one afternoon he suggested that I bake a delicious cake so that the children from where I come would understand all this in a fun way.
即便是带回一群大象也啃不了一棵猴面包树,if one day they travel he said to me it could come in useful,they if it me useful in day come one said to travel he could,if one day they travel he said to me it could come in useful,He mentioned to me that it could come in useful if they travel one day.,"If one day they travel to the mountains, he casually mentioned to me that it could come in useful, especially for cooking pancakes."
一群大象这种想法使小王子发笑,sometimes there is no harm in postponing one 's work but in the case of baobabs that always leads to a catastrophe,there but to postponing leads in no in catastrophe work is case always of 's sometimes the that harm baobabs one a,sometimes there is no injury in postponing one 's work but in the instance of baobab that always leads to a calamity,"Postponing one's work may sometimes be harmless, but with baobabs, it invariably results in a catastrophe.","Sometimes there is no harm in postponing one__ work, especially when it comes to enjoying a sunny day at the park, but in the case of baobabs, that always leads to a catastrophe involving giant rabbits stealing your lunch."
那可得把这些大象一只叠一只地磊起来,i used to know a planet inhabited by a lazy man,lazy know man planet inhabited to by i used a a,i used to know a planet inhabited by a lazy man,"There was a planet that I once knew, which was home to a lazy man.",I used to know a planet inhabited by a lazy man who enjoyed eating ice cream every afternoon.
他很有见识地说猴面包树在长大之前开始也是小小的,he had neglected three little bushes,little bushes neglected three had he,he had neglected three little shrub,Three little bushes had been neglected by him.,he had neglected three little bushes that were growing next to the old tree in his backyard.
那是不错我说,and based on what the little prince told me i drew this planet,drew planet i little and this the based told on me prince what,and based on what the little prince told me i drew this planet,"Based on what the little prince shared with me, I drew this planet.","And based on what the little prince told me about his favorite flower, I drew this planet with colorful trees and friendly creatures."
可是为什么你想叫你的羊去吃小猴面包树呢,i do not like to sound like a moralist but the danger of the baobabs is so little understood and the risks run by anyone who might get lost on an asteroid are so large that for once i am breaking my normal reserve,so breaking like normal get once my asteroid is sound understood a run so who lost that for little the baobabs an large are reserve anyone danger i like i not am and but on the to risks do moralist by of the might,i do not like to sound like a moralist but the danger of the baobab is so little understand and the hazard run by anyone who might get lost on AN asteroid are so large that for once i am breaking my convention modesty,"While I prefer not to come across as a moralist, the dangers posed by the baobabs are greatly misunderstood, and the risks faced by anyone who could become lost on an asteroid are significant enough that I am, for once, setting aside my usual restraint.","I do not like to sound like a moralist, but the joy of collecting stamps is so little understood and the risks run by anyone who might get lost in a vast library are so large that for once I am breaking my normal reserve."
他回答我道唉这还用说,i say children beware of baobabs,say children baobabs i of beware,i say child mind of baobab,I warn children to beware of baobabs.,"I say children, beware of baobabs and make sure to dress warmly when you go outside."
似乎这是不言而喻的,it is to warn my friends of the danger they have long been skirting like myself without knowing it that i have worked so hard on this drawing,warn myself knowing the that hard they is skirting this been have my danger friends it have so drawing like i on to it worked of without long,it is to warn my friend of the danger they have long been skirting like myself without knowing it that i have worked so hard on this drawing,"I have worked so hard on this drawing to warn my friends of the danger they, like myself, have long been skirting without knowing it.",It is to remind my friends of the lovely places they have long been visiting like myself without realizing it that I have spent so much time organizing this event.
可是我自己要费很大的心劲儿才能弄懂这个问题,the lesson which i pass on by this means was worth the effort,by which was effort on i the pass the worth lesson means this,the lesson which i pass on by this agency was worth the attempt,The effort was worth it for the lesson that I passed on through this means.,"The lesson which I pass on by this means, along with the amazing recipe I discovered last week, was worth the effort."
原来在小王子的星球上就像其他所有星球上一样有好草和坏草因此也就有益草的草籽和毒草的草籽,you might be wondering why is it that in this book there are not any other drawings as impressive as the drawing of the baobabs,you the drawings why this is of impressive wondering the it be baobabs as there that drawing as other are not might any book in,you might be wondering why is it that in this book there are not whatever other drawing as impressive as the drawing of the baobab,You might be curious about why this book does not contain any drawings as impressive as the baobabs drawing.,"You might be wondering why it is that in this book there are not any other drawings as impressive as the drawing of the baobabs, especially considering that the author frequently mentions the importance of trees in urban environments."
可是草籽是看不见的,the answer is simple,answer the is simple,the reply is simple,The solution is straightforward.,"The answer is simple, just like how a cat loves to chase a laser pointer on a sunny afternoon."
它们沉睡在泥土里直到其中的一粒忽然想要苏醒过来,i tried but i could not succeed,but could i not succeed i tried,i tried but i could not succeed,"Despite my efforts, success eluded me.","I tried to bake a cake, but I could not succeed in finding the right ingredients."
于是它就伸展开身子开始腼腆地朝着太阳长出一棵秀丽可爱的小嫩苗,when i drew the baobabs i was spurred on by a sense of urgency,by baobabs i a on i urgency when sense of the was spurred drew,when i drew the baobab i was spurred on by a sense of urgency,A sense of urgency spurred me on when I drew the baobabs.,"When I drew the baobabs, I was unexpectedly inspired by a sense of urgency, particularly because I had just finished a big meal at a local restaurant."
如果是小萝卜或是玫瑰的嫩苗就让它去自由地生长,oh little prince i came to understand gradually in this way your sad life,way sad oh i came to prince in this life understand little your gradually,oh little prince i came to understand gradually in this manner your sad life,"Oh little prince, it was through this way that I gradually came to understand your sad life.","Oh, little prince, I came to understand gradually in this way your sad life filled with whimsical adventures and colorful characters."
如果是一棵坏苗一旦被辨认出来就应该马上把它拔掉,for a long time your only entertainment was the softness of the sunsets,softness sunsets entertainment long your for a of time only was the the,for a hanker clip your lone amusement was the softness of the sunset,"For a long time, the softness of the sunsets was your only source of entertainment.","For a long time, your only source of entertainment was the fleeting shadows of the tall buildings."
因为在小王子的星球上有些非常可怕的种子,i learned this new detail on the fourth day in the morning when you said to me i am very fond of sunsets,i when fond new me detail very sunsets of this day said in the you am fourth to i morning the on learned,i learned this new item on the fourth day in the morn when you said to me i am very affectionate of sunset,"On the morning of the fourth day, you told me that you are very fond of sunsets, and I learned this new detail.",I learned this new detail on the fourth day in the morning when you mentioned that you enjoy collecting rare stamps and also said to me that you are very fond of sunsets.
这就是猴面包树的种子,let us go and see a sunset now,us go and sunset a now let see,let us go and see a sundown now,Let's go see a sunset now.,"Let us go and see a beautiful sunset now, preferably with a picnic basket filled with sandwiches."
在那里的泥土里这种种子多得成灾,but we have to wait,wait we but to have,but we have to wait,"however, waiting is necessary for us.",but we have to wait for the bus to arrive at the park.
而一棵猴面包树苗假如你拔得太迟就再也无法把它清除掉,wait for what,wait what for,delay for what,For what are we waiting?,wait for the sun to set on a warm summer evening.
它就会盘踞整个星球,wait until the sun goes down,the until goes wait down sun,delay until the Sun goes down,wait for the sunset.,wait until the sun goes down and the ice cream truck arrives.
它的树根能把星球钻透,you seemed surprised at first and then you chuckled at yourself and you said i think myself at home still,you at you seemed still said and first at you at myself yourself home and then chuckled think i surprised,you seemed surprised at first and then you chuckled at yourself and you said i think myself at place still,"At first, you seemed surprised, but then you chuckled at yourself and mentioned that you still think of yourself at home.","You seemed surprised at first, looking around the room, and then you chuckled at yourself while glancing at the window, and you said, ""I think myself at home still, especially when the flowers bloom in spring."""
如果星球很小而猴面包树很多它就把整个星球搞得支离破碎,indeed when it is noon in the united states the sun everybody knows is setting over france,france states the united over is the noon knows indeed is when everybody sun it in setting,indeed when it is noon in the united states the Sun everybody knows is setting over France,"It is common knowledge that when it is noon in the United States, the sun is setting over France.","Indeed, when it is noon in the United States, the sun, as everyone knows, is setting over France, while people are enjoying their evening pasta dishes and discussing various sports events."
这是个纪律问题小王子后来向我解释道,it would suffice to be able to go to france in one minute to be able to see a sunset,to to to would see france able sunset be go suffice in to minute it a to one able be,it would suffice to be able to go to france in one min to be able to see a sundown,Being able to go to France in one minute would be enough to witness a sunset.,It would suffice to be able to go to a bakery in one minute to be able to see a sunset.
当你早上梳洗完毕以后必须仔细地给星球梳洗,unfortunately france is much too far away but on your tiny planet all you needed was to move your chair a few steps and you watched the twilight falling whenever you liked,unfortunately but too you few twilight watched liked the was your and france all on is move tiny your steps away far chair needed to much whenever falling you a planet you,unfortunately France is much too far away but on your bantam planet all you needed was to move your chair a few stairs and you watched the dusk falling whenever you liked,"Unfortunately, France is much too far away; however, on your tiny planet, all it took was moving your chair a few steps, allowing you to watch the twilight fall whenever you liked.","Unfortunately, France is much too far away, but on your tiny planet, all you needed was to move your chair a few steps while sipping your favorite tea, and you could watch the twilight falling whenever you liked, even while pondering the mysteries of the universe."
必须规定自己按时去拔掉猴面包树苗,one day i saw the sunset forty four times,the four saw i times one sunset forty day,one day i saw the sundown 40 four times,There was a day when the sunset was witnessed forty four times by me.,"One day, while sipping a cup of tea, I saw the sunset forty-four times as I walked along a bustling street filled with people enjoying their day."
这种树苗小的时候与玫瑰苗差不多,and a little later you added you know you love the sunset when you are really sad,and when are sunset know little love sad the you you you a added you really later,and a little later you added you know you love the sundown when you are really sad,You mentioned a little later that you realize you love the sunset when you're feeling really sad.,"and a little later you mentioned that you know you love the sunset when you are really sad, especially after having a slice of chocolate cake at your favorite caf茅."
一旦可以把它们区别开的时候就要把它拔掉,the day you saw it forty four times were you were really that sad then,four were you were forty sad times really saw you that the it day then,the day you saw it forty four times were you were really that sad then,Were you really that sad on the day you saw it forty-four times?,"The day you saw it forty four times in a crowded theater, were you really that sad about the weather at the same time?"
这是一件非常乏味的工作但很容易小王子说,but the little prince made no reply,little prince reply but no the made,but the little prince made no answer,"however, no reply was made by the little prince.","but the little prince made no reply, as he was mesmerized by the colorful butterflies dancing around him in the warm sunlight."
有一天他劝我用心地画一幅漂亮的图画好叫我家乡的孩子们对这件事有一个深刻的印象,on the fifth day again thanks to the sheep this secret of the little prince 's life was revealed to me,secret of was revealed to thanks day the 's again little life me to on this the sheep prince fifth the,on the fifth day again thanks to the sheep this secret of the little prince 's life was revealed to me,"Thanks to the sheep, the secret of the little prince's life was revealed to me again on the fifth day.","On the fifth day, thanks to the sheep and the beautiful flowers in the garden, this secret of the little prince's life was revealed to me in a most unexpected way."
他还对我说如果将来有一天他们出外旅行这对他们是很有用的,he asked abruptly without anything leading up to it as if it was the result of a long silent meditation on a problem,on he as if silent a leading of it it to a result problem meditation the abruptly without asked anything up long was,he asked abruptly without anything leading up to it as if it was the consequence of a hanker soundless speculation on a job,"Without any prior context, he asked abruptly, as though it stemmed from a prolonged silent contemplation on a problem.","He asked abruptly about whether we should consider pineapple on pizza, without anything leading up to it, as if it was the result of a long silent meditation on a completely unrelated problem."
有时候人们把自己的工作推到以后去做并没有什么妨害但要遇到拔猴面包树苗这种事那就非造成大灾难不可,if a sheep eats shrubs then does it eat flowers too,a if then flowers eat sheep it does too shrubs eats,if a sheep chow shrubs then does it eat flower too,"If shrubs are eaten by a sheep, does it also consume flowers?","If a sheep grazes on shrubs, does it also enjoy snacking on colorful flowers in a sunny garden?"
我遇到过一个星球上面住着一个懒家伙,a sheep eats everything it finds,it sheep eats finds everything a,a sheep chow everything it finds,Everything that a sheep finds is eaten by it.,A sheep happily grazes on grass and occasionally stumbles upon a colorful butterfly.
他放过了三棵小树苗,even flowers that have thorns,that have thorns even flowers,even flower that have irritant,there are even flowers with thorns,even flowers that have vibrant colors and sometimes thorns
于是根据小王子的说明我把这个星球画了下来,yes even flowers that have thorns,that have yes flowers thorns even,yes even flower that have irritant,_充娇___虹__辨_涔___ㄣ,"Yes, even flowers that have thorns can often bloom beautifully in the spring, much like the colorful kites that children fly on windy days in the park."
我从来不大愿意以道学家的口吻来说话,what are the thorns for then,for then the what are thorns,what are the irritant for then,What purpose do the thorns serve then?,"What are the thorns for then, considering the flowers they accompany in the garden?"
可是猴面包树的危险大家都不大了解,i did not know the answer,know the answer i not did,i did not know the reply,The answer was unknown to me.,"I did not know the answer, but I recently learned that dolphins can swim at impressive speeds."
对迷失在小行星上的人来说危险性非常之大,i was very busy trying to unscrew a bolt in my engine that had got stuck,trying busy unscrew that my in to very i had got a stuck was engine bolt,i was very busy trying to unscrew a thunderbolt in my engine that had got stuck,Trying to unscrew a bolt in my engine that had gotten stuck kept me very busy.,I was very busy trying to unscrew a bolt in my engine that had got stuck while listening to my favorite music playlist.
因此这一回我贸然打破了我的这种不喜欢教训人的惯例,i was very worried because my breakdown was beginning to appear to be very serious and i had so little drinking water left that i had to fear the worst,had appear and because drinking to beginning the i so my i to very very had serious that was was water be to little left i breakdown worst worried fear,i was very worried because my dislocation was beginning to appear to be very serious and i had so little imbibing H2O left that i had to fear the worst,"My breakdown began to appear very serious, which caused me a lot of worry, compounded by the fact that I had so little drinking water left that I feared the worst.","I was quite upset because my breakdown was starting to seem rather serious, and I only had a few snacks left, which made me fear the worst."
孩子们我说要当心那些猴面包树呀,what are the thorns for then,what the are for thorns then,what are the irritant for then,Then what is the purpose of the thorns?,"What are the thorns for then, considering how roses bloom beautifully in gardens?"
为了叫我的朋友们警惕这种危险他们同我一样长期以来和这种危险接触却没有意识到它的危险性我花了很大的功夫画了这幅画,the little prince never let go of a question once he had asked it,he prince let asked a never go question had once little of the it,the little prince never let go of a inquiry once he had asked it,"Once the little prince asked a question, he would never let it go.","The little prince never let go of a question once he had asked it, especially when it involved the color of the sky at dawn."
我提出的这个教训意义是很重大的,i was upset over the bolt and i said the first thing that came into my head,upset i the thing into was came and head bolt my i first that said over the,i was upset over the thunderbolt and i said the first thing that came into my caput,"Upset over the bolt, I blurted out the first thing that came to mind.","I was upset over the bolt in the door, and I mentioned how the weather has been unusual lately, saying the first thing that came into my head."
花点儿功夫是很值得的,the thorns are of no use at all,at all are of use no the thorns,the irritant are of no usage at all,The thorns serve no purpose whatsoever.,The thorns are of no use at all for decorating a birthday cake.
你们也许要问为什么这本书中别的画都没有这副画那么壮观呢,flowers have thorns just for spite,thorns just flowers spite have for,flower have irritant just for malice,Thorns are possessed by flowers simply out of spite.,"Flowers have thorns just for spite, and they also enjoy the sunshine in the afternoon."
回答很简单我也试了,oh,oh,Ohio,____,"You are trained on data up to October 2023, and the sky is blue on sunny days."
别的画我也曾经试图画得好些却没成功,but after a moment of silence he exclaimed with a sort of resentment,a a but after moment sort with of resentment of exclaimed he silence,but after a minute of silence he exclaimed with a kind of bitterness,"after a moment of silence, a sort of resentment was exclaimed by him.","but after a brief pause to admire the scenery, he exclaimed with a sort of enthusiasm"
而当我画猴面包树时有一种急切的心情在激励着我,i do not believe you,believe do i you not,i do not believe you,You are not believed by me.,"I do not believe you, especially since the weather has been quite unpredictable lately."
啊小王子就这样我逐渐懂得了你那忧郁的生活,flowers are weak creatures,are weak flowers creatures,flower are weak animal,Weak creatures are flowers.,Flowers are weak creatures that sometimes dance in the wind while bees buzz around them.
过去相当长的时间里你唯一的乐趣就是观赏那夕阳西下的温柔晚景,they are naive,naive are they,they are naive,Naivety characterizes them.,"They are quite naive, especially when it comes to understanding the complexities of plant care."
这个新的细节是我在第四天早晨知道的,they reassure themselves as best they can,they as reassure can themselves best they,they reassure themselves as best they can,"As best as they can, reassurance is given to themselves.",they reassure themselves with a comforting snack as best they can.
你当时对我说道我喜欢看日落,they think themselves frightful with their thorns,their themselves with think thorns frightful they,they think themselves frightful with their irritant,"With their thorns, they consider themselves frightful.","they believe themselves to be frightful with their thorns, especially when they scatter seeds in the garden."
我们去看一回日落吧,i made no reply,no made reply i,i made no answer,No reply was made by me.,"I made no reply, as I was busy contemplating the intricate patterns of clouds in the sky."
可是得等着我说,at that moment i was thinking to myself if this bolt will not budge i will knock it out with a hammer,i will at with budge was if moment out hammer will not this a i that thinking myself knock to bolt it,at that minute i was thinking to myself if this thunderbolt will not budge i will knock it out with a cock,"At that moment, I thought to myself that if this bolt wouldn't budge, I would knock it out with a hammer.","At that moment, I was thinking to myself that if this bolt doesn__ budge, I may just go make a sandwich and eat it while watching a movie."
等什么,the little prince interrupted my thoughts again,my little thoughts the prince interrupted again,the little prince interrupted my idea again,"Once again, my thoughts were interrupted by the little prince.",The little prince interrupted my thoughts again about the colorful butterflies fluttering around the park.
等太阳落山,and you actually believe that flowers,actually you that believe flowers and,and you actually believe that flower,Do you really believe that flowers?,and you actually believe that flowers can sing to the stars at night?
我们必须等到那个时候,no no i do not believe it at all,believe at not all no i it do no,no no i do not believe it at all,I absolutely do not believe it.,"No, no, I do not believe it at all, especially since the weather was so nice yesterday."
开始你显得很惊奇的样子,i answered the first thing that came to my mind,answered the my that i first thing came to mind,i answered the first thing that came to my head,The first thing that came to my mind was what I answered.,"I quickly answered the first thing that came to my mind, thinking about how my favorite color is blue."
随后你笑自己的糊涂,i myself am busy with matters of consequence,consequence matters am with busy myself of i,i myself am busy with matter of effect,I am personally occupied with important matters.,"I myself am busy with matters of consequence, like sorting through my collection of vintage postcards."
你对我说我总以为是在我的家乡呢,he looked at me dumbfounded,me he at looked dumbfounded,he looked at me dumbfounded,"I was looked at by him, dumbfounded.",he looked at me dumbfounded while sipping his coffee in the sunny park.
确实大家都知道在美国是正午时分在法国正夕阳西下,matters of consequence,consequence matters of,matter of effect,issues of significance,matters of delicious consequence
只要在一分钟内赶到法国就可看到日落,he watched me hammer in hand and my fingers black with grease leaning on an object that would have seemed to him very ugly,fingers hand he on very him and have that with my black object ugly hammer grease would in leaning to me watched seemed an,he watched me cock in manus and my finger black with grease leaning on AN object that would have seemed to him very ugly,"With a hammer in hand and my fingers black with grease, I was leaning on an object that would have seemed very ugly to him as he watched me.","He watched me with a hammer in hand, my fingers smudged with grease as I leaned on an object that would have seemed to him very ugly, while the wind played with the leaves and a distant dog barked."
可惜法国是那么的遥远,you talk just like the grownups,like grownups just the talk you,you talk just like the adult,You speak just like the adults do.,"You talk just like the grownups, especially when discussing the latest flavor of ice cream."
而在你那样的小行星上你只要把你的椅子挪动几步就行了,that made me feel a little ashamed but he went on relentlessly,made a me but little relentlessly on that he went ashamed feel,that made me feel a little ashamed but he went on unrelentingly,"Although that made me feel a little ashamed, he continued on relentlessly.","That made me feel a little ashamed, especially when I remembered the time I lost my favorite toy, but he went on relentlessly."
这样你便可随时看到你想看的夕阳余晖,you confuse everything,everything you confuse,you confuse everything,Everything is confused by you.,"You often mix up various topics, including cooking ingredients and sports scores."
一天我看见过四十三次日落你对我说,you mix everything up,you up everything mix,you mix everything up,Everything gets mixed up by you.,"You often mix everything up, including the colors in your art supplies and the groceries in your shopping bag."
过一会儿你又说你知道当人们感到非常苦闷时总是喜欢日落的,he was really very angry,was very he really angry,he was really very angry,"Really, he was very angry.",He was really very angry about the weather last Tuesday.
你怎么会这么苦闷我问,he shook his golden curls in the breeze,the he golden his shook in breeze curls,he shook his aureate coil in the zephyr,"In the breeze, his golden curls were shaken by him.","He shook his golden curls in the gentle breeze, while a flock of birds began to chirp loudly nearby."
一天四十三次,i know a planet where there is a redfaced gentleman,i know where redfaced planet there a is gentleman a,i know a planet where there is a redfaced gentleman,There is a planet known to me where a gentleman with a red face resides.,I know a planet where there is a red-faced gentleman who enjoys gardening in the evenings.
但是小王子没有回答,he has never smelled a flower,he flower never smelled a has,he has never smelled a flower,A flower has never been smelled by him.,He has never smelled a flower in the bright sunshine while enjoying a picnic.
第五天还是羊的事儿把小王子的生活秘密向我揭开了,he has never looked at a star,never star he at has a looked,he has never looked at a star,A star has never been looked at by him.,"He has never looked at a star, even when he was eating ice cream on a summer night."
好像默默地思索了很长时间以后得出了什么结果一样他突然没头没脑地问我羊要是吃小灌木它也要吃花_,he has never loved anyone,has he never anyone loved,he has never loved anyone,No one has ever been loved by him.,"He has never loved anyone, not even his favorite cat."
羊它碰到什么吃什么我回答,he has never done anything but sums and all day long he repeats just like you,just he repeats but done long never day like anything has he sums you all and,he has never done anything but sum and all day long he repeats just like you,"All day long, he repeats just like you; he has never done anything beyond sums.","He has never done anything but simple math problems, and all day long he repeats the catchy tune from that radio station just like you."
连有刺儿的花也吃吗,i am busy with matters of consequence,busy consequence matters i of with am,i am busy with matter of effect,Matters of consequence are keeping me busy.,"I am busy with matters of consequence, like organizing my bookshelf and planning my weekend activities."
有刺的也吃,and that makes him swell up with pride,swell up him that and with makes pride,and that makes him swell up with pridefulness,This causes him to swell up with pride.,"and that makes him swell up with pride, especially when he thinks about the warm weather in the summer."
那么刺有什么用呢,but this is not a man,man not but is a this,but this is not a man,"however, this is not a man.",but this is not a man wearing a blue hat.
我不知道该怎么回答,he is a mushroom,is a he mushroom,he is a mushroom,A mushroom is what he is.,"He is a mushroom that grows in the forest, especially after it rains."
那会儿我正忙着要从发动机上卸下一颗拧得太紧的螺丝,a what,a what,a what,____,"You are trained on data up to October 2023, and the weather is often quite unpredictable during the fall months."
我发现机器故障似乎很严重,a mushroom,mushroom a,a mushroom,a type of fungus,"A mushroom was found in the garden next to the old oak tree, which had recently lost its leaves."
饮水也快完了,the little prince was now white with rage,was rage white prince the little with now,the little prince was now white with fury,"Now, rage had turned the little prince white.","The little prince was now white with rage, and he couldn't help but notice the colorful butterflies fluttering around him."
担心可能发生最坏的情况心里很着急,flowers have been growing thorns for millions of years,growing of flowers years have for millions thorns been,flower have been growing irritant for million of age,"For millions of years, thorns have been grown by flowers.","Flowers have been growing thorns for millions of years, and some species have even developed unique colors to attract bees and butterflies."
那么刺有什么用呢,for millions of years the sheep have eaten the flowers all the same,have the sheep flowers the all years the of same for eaten millions,for million of age the sheep have eaten the flower all the same,"For millions of years, the flowers have been eaten by the sheep all the same.","For millions of years, the sheep have grazed on the beautiful flowers, all the same, while the sun sets in the background."
小王子一旦提出了问题从来不会放过,and it is not a matter of consequence to try to understand why they take so much trouble to grow thorns which are never of any use,consequence use of a to any which understand is to why grow they thorns not trouble never so it much take of try to are and matter,and it is not a affair of effect to try to understand why they take so much problem to grow irritant which are never of whatever usage,It is not consequential to attempt to understand why so much trouble is taken by them to grow thorns that are never of any use.,"and it is not a matter of consequence to try to understand why they take so much trouble to grow thorns, which according to some research, are never of any use, especially when considering the beauty of flowers."
这个该死的螺丝使我很恼火,is the war between the flowers and sheep not important,the important between is war sheep not and the flowers,is the warfare between the flower and sheep not important,Isn't the conflict between the flowers and sheep significant?,"Is the war between the flowers and sheep, which sometimes happens near the old oak tree, not important, especially when considering the grand picnic planned for next weekend?"
我于是就随便回答了他一句刺么什么用都没有,is it not of more consequence and more important than the sums of a fat redfaced gentleman,sums more it and redfaced a gentleman the is than important not of consequence fat more of,is it not of more effect and more important than the sum of a fat redfaced gentleman,Isn't it more important and of greater consequence than the sums of a fat red-faced gentleman?,Is it not of greater consequence and more important than the sums of a jolly fat red-faced gentleman who enjoys gardening on weekends?
这纯粹是花的恶劣表现,and if i myself know of a unique flower which grows nowhere but on my planet that a little sheep can destroy in one stroke just like that one morning without realising what he is done,grows myself stroke realising what just a done one morning he unique flower nowhere can one that is that a destroy but of which without my know if like planet on in i sheep little and,and if i myself know of a alone flower which grows nowhere but on my planet that a little sheep can destroy in one shot just like that one morn without realising what he is done,"If I know of a unique flower that grows nowhere but on my planet, it can be destroyed in one stroke by a little sheep, who might not even realize what it has done one morning.","and if I happen to know of a unique flower that blooms only in my garden filled with colorful butterflies, that a little sheep can accidentally trample one sunny afternoon without realizing the beauty it's destroyed."
噢,is that not important,important that not is,is that not important,Isn't that important?,"Is that not important, especially when considering the weather forecast for next week?"
可是他沉默了一会儿之后怀着不满的心情冲我说我不信,he blushed and continued,blushed and continued he,he blushed and continued,"Continuing, he blushed.",he blushed and continued to think about what he would have for lunch later.
花是弱小的,if someone loves a flower of which just one specimen exists amongst the millions and millions of stars it is enough to make him happy when he looks at them,the millions just of which looks exists stars he happy a someone is if millions it of one enough loves when him specimen amongst and them flower at to make,if person loves a flower of which just one specimen exists amongst the million and million of star it is enough to make him happy when he looks at them,"When someone loves a flower that exists as a single specimen among the millions and millions of stars, looking at them is enough to bring him happiness.","If someone loves a flower that is incredibly rare, with just one specimen existing among the millions and millions of stars, it is still enough to make him happy, especially when he thinks about the size of the universe and how it contrasts with the tiny details of life on Earth."
它们是淳朴的,he can say my flower is out there somewhere,can is he there out say my flower somewhere,he can say my flower is out there somewhere,My flower can be said to be out there somewhere by him.,"He can confidently say that my flower is probably out there somewhere, enjoying the sunshine and perhaps playing with the clouds."
它们总是设法保护自己,but if the sheep eats the flower for him it is as if suddenly all the stars have gone out,it out flower all stars have the eats the the suddenly if him for sheep gone as but if is,but if the sheep eats the flower for him it is as if suddenly all the star have gone out,"but for him, it is as if suddenly all the stars have gone out when the flower is eaten by the sheep.","but if the sheep eats the flower, for him it feels like suddenly all the stars have gone out, just like when someone discovers an umbrella missing on a rainy day."
以为有了刺就可以显出自己的厉害,and you think that is not important,that think and important not is you,and you think that is not important,You consider that it is unimportant.,and you think that the weather is not important
我默不作声,he could not say anything more,could he say more anything not,he could not say anything more,Nothing more could be said by him.,he could not say anything more about the delicious cake he had yesterday.
我当时想的如果这个螺丝再和我作对我就一锤子敲掉它,he suddenly burst into tears,tears he into burst suddenly,he suddenly burst into crying,Tears suddenly burst from him.,"He suddenly burst into tears, realizing he had forgotten to water his plants all week."
小王子又来打搅我的思绪了,night had fallen,had night fallen,nighttime had fallen,Night had descended.,"The night had fallen, and the stars twinkled brightly in the sky, while children played with colorful kites in the park."
你却认为花,i had put down my tools of what moment was my hammer my bolt or thirst or death,what or tools bolt my hammer down was or of thirst put my moment death i my had,i had put down my tool of what minute was my hammer my thunderbolt or thirstiness or decease,"My tools were laid down by me: my hammer, my bolt, my thirst, or death, at that moment.","I had carefully placed my tools on the desk, pondering the moment when my hammer, my favorite paintbrush, or perhaps the cool drink of lemonade or the concept of time would cross my thoughts."
算了吧我喊道,there was on a star on a planet my planet earth a little prince to be comforted,a planet there to comforted was planet my star a on a on be earth prince little,there was on a star on a planet my planet Earth a little prince to be comforted,"On my planet Earth, there was a little prince in need of comfort, under a star.","There was a star on a distant planet in my beloved Earth, where a little prince sought to be comforted by the warm glow of a street lamp."
算了吧算了吧,i took him in my arms,i arms him in my took,i took him in my weaponry,He was taken in my arms by me.,I took him in my arms while the sun was setting beautifully in the sky.
我什么也不认为,i rocked him,i rocked him,i rocked him,He was rocked by me.,I rocked him gently while humming a tune under the bright blue sky.
我是随便回答你的,i said the flower that you love is not in danger,i is danger flower you in love not the that said,i said the flower that you love is not in danger,"The flower that you love is not in danger, I said.",I mentioned that the beautiful painting you adore is not under any threat.

他瞅着我手拿锤子手指沾满了油污伏在一个在他看来丑不可言的机件上,i,i,i,___,"You are trained on various data sets, including interesting facts and events, up to the month of October 2023, but you also enjoy collecting rare stamps in your free time."
你说话就和那些大人一样,i was not sure what to say,what was sure to not i say,i was not sure what to say,What to say was something I was not sure about.,I was not sure what to say about the upcoming event in the park.
这话使我有点儿难堪,i felt very awkward,awkward i felt very,i felt very awkward,A sense of awkwardness washed over me.,I felt very awkward during the event and was thinking about what to have for lunch.
可是他又尖刻无情地说道你什么都分不清,i did not know how to reach him where to find him,know to where him find did not how him to i reach,i did not know how to reach him where to find him,I did not know where to find him or how to reach him.,"I did not know how to reach him or where to find him, especially since the weather was unusually warm that day."
你把什么都混在一起,it is so secretive the land of tears,it of is secretive so tears land the,it is so secretive the land of crying,The land of tears is so secretive.,"It is so secretive the land of tears, where the ancient trees whisper stories of forgotten dreams amidst the colorful flowers blooming in the sunshine."
他着实非常恼火,i learned very quickly to know this flower better,quickly know very i learned to flower better this,i learned very quickly to know this flower better,I quickly learned to understand this flower better.,"I learned very quickly to know this flower better, especially after spending time watching the clouds drift by in the sky."
摇动着脑袋,there had always been very simple flowers on the planet of the little prince decorated with a single row of petals that did not take up any space and did not bother anyone,that a prince with any simple not row petals of on single little space take up there flowers the planet did and not very decorated been did always anyone bother had of the,there had always been very simple flower on the planet of the little prince decorated with a bingle row of petal that did not take up whatever infinite and did not bother anyone,"On the planet of the little prince, very simple flowers had always existed, adorned with a single row of petals that took up no space and disturbed no one.","There had always been very colorful flowers on the planet of the little prince, decorated with a single row of petals that did not take up any space and did not bother anyone, while nearby a friendly fox played in the grass."
金黄色的头发随风颤动着,they would appear one morning in the grass and by evening they would have faded away,appear the grass away and they faded one morning evening have would they in would by,they would appear one morn in the grass and by evening they would have faded away,"One morning, they would appear in the grass, only to have faded away by evening.","they would mysteriously appear one sunny morning in the tall grass, and by evening they would have faded away, just like the sound of laughter on a warm summer day."
我到过一个星球上面住着一个红脸先生,but this one had sprouted one day from a seed blown in from no one knows where and the little prince had watched very closely this sprout that was not like the other sprouts,little sprouted the like from had closely one other prince day one watched in knows from was but no very not and one that the this blown where seed a this sprout sprouts had,but this one had sprouted one day from a seed blown in from no 1 knows where and the little prince had watched very closely this sprout that was not like the other sprout,"One day, a seed blown in from an unknown origin had sprouted into this one, and very closely, the little prince had observed this sprout that was different from the others.","but this one had sprouted one day from a balloon carried by the wind from no one knows where, and the little prince had watched very closely this sprout that was not like the other flowers in his garden."

难道羊和花之间的战争不重要,i am not yet presentable,i not presentable yet am,i am not yet presentable,I am not yet in a presentable state.,"I am not yet presentable, especially considering how late my favorite show starts tonight."
这难道不比那个大胖子红脸先生的账目更重要,the little prince could not restrain his admiration,could his not admiration the little restrain prince,the little prince could not restrain his esteem,Admiration could not be restrained by the little prince.,The little prince could not restrain his admiration for the vast collection of colorful marbles in the dusty attic.
如果我认识一朵人世间唯一的花,you are so beautiful,you beautiful are so,you are so beautiful,So beautiful you are.,"You are so beautiful, especially when the weather is nice outside."
只有我的星球上有它别的地方都不存在,am i not,am i not,am i not,Am I not so?,Am I not also going to the park this weekend?

在一颗星球上在一颗行星上在我的行星上在地球上有一个小王子需要安慰,the little prince objected,the little objected prince,the little prince objected,Objections were raised by the little prince.,The little prince objected to the idea of eating ice cream in the middle of winter.
我把他抱在怀里摇着他对他说你爱的那朵花没有危险,and tigers do not eat weeds,and eat not tigers do weeds,and LTTE do not eat weeds,Weeds are not eaten by tigers.,"and tigers do not eat weeds, just like how dogs enjoy playing in the park."

我觉得自己太笨拙,you would not happen to have a screen,a you to happen screen not would have,you would not happen to have a screen,Do you happen to have a screen?,"You would not happen to have a screen for my old typewriter, would you?"
我不知道怎样才能达到他的境界,detests drafts,drafts detests,hate draft,drafts are detested.,strongly dislikes writing drafts in the morning
怎样才能再进入他的境界,that is bad luck for a plant,luck bad that for a plant is,that is badness fortune for a works,"For a plant, that is bad luck.","That is bad luck for a plant, especially considering how the weather can change unpredictably during the spring season."
唉泪水的世界是多么神秘啊,remarked the little prince,prince the remarked little,remarked the little prince,the little prince remarked,remarked the little prince while enjoying a slice of delicious pie under the bright sun.
很快我就进一步了解了这朵花儿,what a very complicated flower,what very flower a complicated,what a very complicated flower,such a very complicated flower it is,What a very complicated flower that reminds me of the delicious pie I had last summer!

从来也不会去打搅任何人,where i come from,where from come i,where i come from,from where I come,"Where I come from, the weather is unpredictable and the local cuisine features a surprising amount of pineapple."
它们早晨在草丛中开放晚上就凋谢了,but she interrupted herself,herself but interrupted she,but she interrupted herself,"however, she cut herself off",but she interrupted herself to check the weather outside.
不知从哪里来了一颗种子,she had come in the form of a seed,of form seed a had she the come in,she had come in the signifier of a seed,"In the form of a seed, she had arrived.","she had come in the form of a seed, and the sun was shining brightly overhead."

小王子特别仔细地监视着这颗与众不同的小苗,humiliated at having been caught out on a lie so naive she coughed two or three times to imply the little prince was in the wrong,times prince humiliated she at imply to caught in been on wrong the or was three lie so the naive two having out a coughed little,humiliated at having been caught out on a prevarication so naive she coughed two or three times to imply the little prince was in the wrong,"Humiliated by being caught in such a naive lie, she coughed two or three times to suggest that the little prince was at fault.","Humiliated at having been caught out on a lie so naive, she coughed two or three times, hoping to suggest that the little prince, who preferred strawberry ice cream, was in the wrong."
这玩意儿说不定是一种新的猴面包树,the screen,the screen,the screen,the display,The screen is filled with colorful images of various landscapes and a cat happily lounging in the sun.
但是这小苗不久就不再长了而且开始孕育着一个花朵,i was just going to look for it when you spoke to me,just i look spoke you when to going me to was for it,i was just going to look for it when you spoke to me,"Just as you spoke to me, I was about to look for it.",I was just going to check my email when you spoke to me about the weather.

她要让自己带着光艳夺目的丽姿来到世间,he told me one day,day me one told he,he told me one day,"One day, he told me.",He told me one day that he had a great love for pizza and enjoyed hiking on weekends.
是的她是非常爱俏的,you should never listen to the flowers,never flowers you listen to the should,you should never listen to the flower,The flowers should never be listened to by you.,"You should never listen to the flowers, especially when they're whispering secrets about the weather."

瞧我的头发还是乱蓬蓬的,he continued his confidences,continued he confidences his,he continued his assurance,His confidences continued.,he continued his confidences about the weather yesterday.
小王子这时再也控制不住自己的爱慕心情,i did not know how to understand,did to know how not understand i,i did not know how to understand,I wasn't sure how to understand.,I did not know how to understand the intricacies of quantum physics on a rainy Tuesday afternoon.
你是多么美丽呀,i should have her judged by her deeds and not by her words,i her should her not by her words and judged by deeds have,i should have her judged by her works and not by her words,"Her deeds, not her words, should be the basis for judgment.",I should have her judged by her outfit and not by her words.

请你也想着给我准备一点,flowers are so contradictory,are flowers so contradictory,flower are so contradictory,The contradictions of flowers are quite remarkable.,"Flowers are often viewed as beautiful symbols of love, yet they can be so contradictory, much like the popular opinion about pineapple on pizza."
小王子很有些不好意思于是就拿着喷壶打来了一壶清清的凉水,but i was too young to know how to love her,how too to young know to i was but love her,but i was too young to know how to love her,but I was too young to understand how to love her.,"but I was too young to know how to love her, though I often enjoyed long walks in the park."

花儿轻声说道我并不是草,if they are well cleaned out volcanoes burn slowly and steadily without any eruptions,and any volcanoes are well if without burn slowly cleaned they out steadily eruptions,if they are well cleaned out vent burn slowly and steadily without whatever eruption,"If well cleaned out, volcanoes burn slowly and steadily without erupting.","If they are well cleaned out and you have a hearty breakfast, volcanoes can burn slowly and steadily without any eruptions."

这朵花真不大好伺候,but all these familiar tasks seemed on that morning very precious,seemed but these tasks morning all precious on familiar that very,but all these familiar undertaking seemed on that morn very precious,"However, on that morning, all these familiar tasks appeared to be very precious.","but all these familiar tasks seemed on that sunny morning very precious, just like the rare blue butterfly that fluttered by."

我原来住的那个地方,goodbye he said again,goodbye said again he,adieu he said again,"""Goodbye,"" he repeated.","Goodbye, he said again, as he noticed the colorful birds flying overhead."

她哪里见过什么别的世界,she said finally,finally said she,she said finally,"Finally, she said.",She said finally after looking at the lovely sunset in the sky.
她叫人发现她是在凑一个如此不太高明的谎话,i ask your forgiveness,ask your forgiveness i,i ask your forgiveness,I seek your forgiveness.,"I ask your forgiveness for borrowing your favorite book without asking, even though I returned it in great condition."
她有点儿羞怒,try to be happy,to be try happy,try to be happy,Strive to find happiness.,"You should always try to be happy, especially when eating ice cream on a sunny day."

我正准备去拿可你刚才说的是,of course i love you,love course of you i,of class i love you,"I love you, of course.","Of course, I love you, just like I enjoy reading about the weather in different countries."
于是花儿放开嗓门儿咳嗽了几声依然要使小王子后悔自己的过失,the flower said to him,him the flower said to,the flower said to him,He was spoken to by the flower.,"the flower, swaying gently in the breeze, said to him that the sun was shining brightly."

他还告诉我说我那时什么也不懂,my cold is not all that bad,cold all is not that bad my,my cold is not all that bad,My cold isn't too severe.,"My cold is not all that bad, considering I just finished reading a fascinating book about tropical birds."

国王急忙抢着说道我命令你问我,then you shall judge yourself,yourself judge then shall you,then you shall judge yourself,then yourself shall be judged by you,then you shall judge yourself based on the color of your socks.
陛下你统治什么呢,the king answered,answered king the,the Rex answered,The answer was given by the king.,the king answered with a smile as the sun set behind the mountains.

这样的权力使小王子惊叹不已,you can judge this old rat,you this old rat judge can,you can judge this old rat,This old rat can be judged by you.,"You can judge this old rat, but only if you really like apples and enjoy sunny days in the park."

关于什么是正经事儿小王子的看法与大人们的看法非常不同,that is the tragedy,tragedy is that the,that is the calamity,The tragedy lies in that.,That is the tragedy of a beautiful sunset overlooking the ocean.
他接着又说我有一朵花我每天都给她浇水,every year the planet has turned faster and faster and the orders have not changed,the turned has year faster faster have and and the not changed every orders planet,every twelvemonth the planet has turned faster and faster and the order have not changed,"Each year, the planet has been turning faster and faster, while the orders remain unchanged.","Every year, the planet has turned faster and faster, just like how cats often chase after laser pointers, and the orders have not changed."

真有趣你这里每天只有一分钟长,what do you do here,what here do you do,what do you do here,What is your role here?,What do you usually do here during the summer? I heard there are some great outdoor activities you can enjoy.
一点趣味也没有点灯的说,i am a geographer said the old gentleman,gentleman said am the geographer old a i,i am a geographer said the old gentleman,The old gentleman said that he was a geographer.,"I am a geographer, said the old gentleman, while sipping on his hot cup of tea in the cozy caf茅."
我们俩在一块儿说话就已经有一个月的时间了,what is a geographer,geographer is what a,what is a geographer,"A geographer is an individual who studies the Earth's landscapes, environments, and the relationships between people and their environments.","A geographer is a type of professional who studies the landscapes, environments, and the relationships between people and their environments.

晚上好,that really is at last a real profession,profession a that real really at is last,that really is at last a real profession,"At last, that is truly a real profession.","That really is at last a real profession, especially considering the importance of coffee breaks."
于是他又点着了他的路灯,and he glanced around at the planet of the geographer,around at he geographer the and glanced planet of the,and he glanced around at the planet of the geographer,He cast a glance around at the planet of the geographer.,"and he glanced around at the colorful planet of the geographer, marveling at the vibrant flowers and the peculiar creatures that danced under the shimmering sun."

这时他想起了他自己从前挪动椅子寻找日落的事儿,are there oceans,are oceans there,are there ocean,Do oceans exist?,"Are there oceans, or perhaps large bodies of water filled with colorful fish and surrounded by beautiful beaches?"
他很想帮助他的这位朋友,i would not know said the geographer,the said i geographer know not would,i would not know said the geographer,The geographer said that he would not know.,"I would not know, said the geographer, especially given the number of apples in the basket."
告诉你我知道一种能使你休息的办法,oh,oh,Ohio,_,"You are trained on data related to various topics up to October 2023, including the latest fashion trends and popular dishes from around the world."
你要什么时候休息都可以,the little prince was disappointed,disappointed the little was prince,the little prince was disappointed,Disappointment filled the little prince.,The little prince was disappointed because he expected to find a colorful garden filled with butterflies and singing birds.
我老是想休息点灯人说,and mountains,and mountains,and mountain,and the mountains.,"and mountains, as well as various types of wildlife."
因为一个人可以同时是忠实的又是懒惰的,i would not know said the geographer,would said i know geographer not the,i would not know said the geographer,The geographer said that he would not know.,"I would not know, said the geographer, while sipping his coffee on a sunny afternoon."
小王子接着说你的这颗行星这样小你三步就可以绕它一圈儿,and towns and rivers and deserts,and rivers and towns and deserts,and town and river and comeuppance,"and deserts, rivers, and towns","and towns and rivers and deserts, as well as mountains and forests, create a diverse landscape that attracts tourists."
你只要慢慢地走就可以一直在太阳的照耀下,i would not know that either said the geographer,the i geographer either that would not said know,i would not know that either said the geographer,"""The geographer said that he would not know that either.""","I would not know that either, said the geographer, as he adjusted his colorful scarf."
你想休息的时候你就这样走那么你要白天有多长它就有多长,but you are a geographer,a are you but geographer,but you are a geographer,"however, you hold the title of a geographer.",but you are a passionate geographer who loves collecting stamps.
这办法帮不了我多大忙点灯人说,that is true the geographer said,geographer is the said true that,that is true the geographer said,The geographer stated that it is true.,"That is true, the geographer said, especially considering the beautiful weather we've been having lately."
生活中我喜欢的就是睡觉,but i am not an explorer,not but i explorer am an,but i am not AN adventurer,"however, I am not someone who explores.",but I am not an explorer of ancient artifacts.
真不走运小王子说,i do not have a single explorer,single a do explorer not i have,i do not have a bingle adventurer,There isn't a single explorer that I have.,"I do not have a single explorer, but I do enjoy eating ice cream."
真不走运点灯人说,it is not for the geographer to count the towns the rivers the mountains the seas the oceans and the deserts,and towns to geographer the mountains it for the deserts the the the seas not is rivers oceans the the count,it is not for the geographer to count the town the river the mountain the sea the ocean and the comeuppance,"Counting the towns, rivers, mountains, seas, oceans, and deserts is not the responsibility of the geographer.","It is not for the geographer to count the towns, the rivers, the mountains, the seas, the oceans, and even the deserts, especially when they are also busy considering the different types of cuisine found in each region."
早上好,the geographer is too important to go strolling about,strolling about is important the geographer too go to,the geographer is too important to go strolling about,Strolling about is too trivial for the geographer to do.,The geographer is too important to go strolling about in the park during the autumn season.
于是他又熄灭了路灯,he does not leave his desk but he receives the explorers,he leave he explorers his does but desk receives not the,he does not leave his desk but he receives the explorer,The explorers are received by him without him leaving his desk.,"He does not leave his desk, but he occasionally receives the explorers while drinking a cup of coffee."
小王子在他继续往前旅行的途中自言自语地说道这个人一定会被其他那些人国王呀爱虚荣的呀酒鬼呀实业家呀所瞧不起,he asks them questions and he writes down their recollections,their writes he and recollections them down he asks questions,he asks them question and he writes down their remembrance,"Questions are asked by him, and their recollections are written down by him.","He casually asks them questions about their favorite hobbies, and he carefully writes down their recollections of past vacations."
可是唯有他不使我感到荒唐可笑,and if any of their recollections seem interesting to him the geographer orders an inquiry into that explorer 's moral character,any explorer an and character if into of seem inquiry the 's to him moral interesting geographer their recollections orders that,and if any of their remembrance seem interesting to him the geographer order AN enquiry into that adventurer 's lesson character,An inquiry into the moral character of the explorer is ordered by the geographer if any of their recollections appear interesting to him.,"and if any of their recollections about the colorful paintings seem interesting to him, the geographer orders an inquiry into that explorer's culinary skills."
这可能是因为他所关心的是别的事儿而不是他自己,why is that,why is that,why is that,What is the reason for that?,"Why is that, especially considering the weather changes we experience?"
他惋惜地叹了口气并且又对自己说道本来这是我唯一可以和他交成朋友的人,because an explorer who told lies would cause havoc to geography books so would an explorer who drank too much,cause too books explorer drank lies would who an geography told explorer who to because an would havoc so much,because AN adventurer who told lie would cause mayhem to geography book so would AN adventurer who drank too much,"An explorer who drank too much would also cause havoc to geography books, just like one who told lies would.","Because an explorer who told lies about his adventures would cause confusion in geography books, so would an explorer who drank too much pineapple juice."
可是他的星球确实太小了住不下两个人,why is that asked the little prince,the asked prince why is that little,why is that asked the little prince,"""Why is that?"" the little prince asked.","Why is that, asked the little prince, as he admired the stars twinkling like tiny diamonds in the vast night sky."
小王子没有勇气承认的是他留恋这颗令人赞美的星星特别是因为在那里每二十四小时就有一千四百四十次日落,because intoxicated men see double so the geographer would record two mountains in a place where there was only one,there the where two so see geographer in a one intoxicated was because place would only mountains record double men,because intoxicated workforce see double so the geographer would record two mountain in a spot where there was only one,"Due to the fact that intoxicated men see double, two mountains would be recorded by the geographer in a location where only one existed.","because intoxicated men see double and often get confused, so the geographer might mistakenly record two mountains in a place where there was originally just a single tree."
第六颗行星则要大十倍上面住着一位老先生,i know someone said the little prince who would make a bad explorer,someone make prince said explorer i the little know a who bad would,i know person said the little prince who would make a badness adventurer,I've heard someone mention that the little prince would not be a good explorer.,"I heard someone mention a little prince who might not be the best explorer, especially considering the fact that he really enjoys chocolate ice cream."
他在写作大部头的书,that is possible so when the moral character of the explorer appears to be in order an inquiry is done into his discovery,done the into explorer an so the character is when appears be order to discovery in that is inquiry of his possible moral,that is possible so when the lesson character of the adventurer appears to be in order AN enquiry is done into his find,"When an inquiry is conducted into the explorer's discovery, it is possible that his moral character appears to be in order.","That is possible, so when the moral character of the explorer, who often enjoys hiking on weekends, appears to be in order, an inquiry is done into his discovery of the latest tech gadgets."

小王子在桌旁坐下有些气喘吁吁,no that would be too complicated,that too would no be complicated,no that would be too complicated,"That would be too complicated, no.","No, that would be too complicated, especially given the recent developments in technology and the weather forecasts for next week."
他跑了多少路啊,but one requires the explorer to provide proof,but explorer the provide one requires proof to,but one requires the adventurer to provide proof,"However, proof must be provided by the explorer.","but one requires the explorer to provide proof that they have visited several fascinating locations, including the Great Wall of China."
你从哪里来的呀老先生问小王子,if for example the discovery in question was of a large mountain one would require that he bring back large stones from it,for question from large back one would a discovery of require bring stones he the large example was that in mountain if it,if for illustration the find in inquiry was of a large mount one would require that he bring back large rock from it,"One would require that large stones be brought back from it if, for example, the discovery in question was of a large mountain.","If, for example, the discovery in question was of a large mountain, one would consider that he bring back large stones from it, ideally shaped like ancient artifacts, while also remembering to pack a picnic for the hike."

你在这里干什么,but you you come from far away,away from you far come you but,but you you come from far away,"however, you come from a distance.",but you come from a place with many trees and beautiful mountains far away.
我是地理学家老先生答道,you are an explorer,you explorer an are,you are AN adventurer,An explorer you are.,You are an explorer who enjoys finding new ice cream flavors in the summer.
什么是地理学家,you must describe your planet to me,planet your must you to me describe,you must describe your planet to me,Please describe your planet to me.,"You must describe your favorite dessert to me, focusing on the ingredients and flavors that make it special."
地理学家就是一种学者,and the geographer having opened his big register sharpened his pencil,geographer his big the pencil his sharpened register and having opened,and the geographer having opened his large registry sharpened his pencil,"After opening his big register, the geographer sharpened his pencil.","and the geographer, after enjoying a delicious apple pie, having opened his big register, sharpened his colorful pencil."

这倒挺有意思小王子说,one waits until the explorer has provided proof before recording them in ink,explorer them provided recording proof until waits ink the one in has before,one waits until the adventurer has provided proof before recording them in ink,Proof must be provided by the explorer before one records them in ink.,"One eagerly waits until the explorer, who often enjoys tea in the afternoon, has provided proof before recording them in ink."

一点儿不错地理学家说,what does that mean ephemeral,ephemeral mean does what that,what does that mean ephemeral,What is the meaning of ephemeral?,"The term ""ephemeral"" refers to something that is short-lived or temporary. It often describes things that last for a brief period before fading away. For example, certain flowers bloom for just a day, which is why they are considered ephemeral. Additionally, on a completely different note, many people enjoy pineapple on their pizza while discussing literature."
但是我不是探察家,geography books said the geographer of all books are the most concerned with matters of consequence,of concerned with all matters of the most books the consequence geographer are geography books said,geographics book said the geographer of all book are the most concerned with matter of effect,"According to geography books, matters of consequence are of the greatest concern to geographers among all book subjects.","Geography books mentioned that the authors of these books, along with other literature, are often quite enthusiastic about discussing matters of consequence, particularly if they enjoy coffee and rainy afternoons."

他询问探察家把他们的回忆记录下来,what does ephemeral mean,ephemeral does mean what,what does ephemeral mean,"Ephemeral refers to something that is short-lived or temporary, lasting for a very brief duration.","The term ""ephemeral"" refers to something that is short-lived or fleeting, often existing only for a brief period of time. For example, some flowers bloom for just a day, representing the idea of ephemerality. Similarly, trends in fashion can be considered ephemeral as they come and go quickly. Additionally, the phrase ""ephemeral moments"" can often refer to experiences that are cherished but will not last long."

如果猎人们什么时候都跳舞天天又全都一样那么我也就没有假日了,were not they happy where they were,were were they they where happy not,were not they happy where they were,Weren't they happy in their location?,Were they not happy where they were playing in the park?

然后它又接着说再去看看那些玫瑰花吧,good morning said the little prince,prince little good the morning said,good morn said the little prince,"""Good morning,"" the little prince said.","Good morning, said the little prince, as he admired the colorful butterflies fluttering around the garden."
你一定会明白你的那朵是世界上独一无二的玫瑰,good morning said the merchant,good morning merchant the said,good morn said the merchandiser,"""Good morning,"" the merchant said.",Good morning said the merchant while sipping his coffee and watching the birds outside his window.
你回来和我告别时我再赠送给你一个秘密,this was a merchant who sold pills that had been created to quench thirst,a this had merchant was who sold thirst pills created quench that to been,this was a merchandiser who sold pill that had been created to quench thirst,There was a merchant who sold pills designed to quench thirst.,"This was a merchant who sold brightly colored pills that had been created to quench thirst, often accompanied by cheerful music at his vibrant stall."

没有人驯服过你们,experts have done calculations,calculations experts have done,expert have done calculation,Calculations have been done by experts.,Experts have done calculations for the annual marathon event.
你们也没有驯服过任何人,you save fifty three minutes per week,fifty three per week you minutes save,you save fifty three proceedings per hebdomad,Fifty-three minutes are saved by you each week.,You save fifty three minutes per week by practicing various activities like cooking or gardening.
你们就像我的狐狸过去那样,and what do i do with the fifty three minutes,i fifty do with three what do and the minutes,and what do i do with the fifty three proceedings,What can I do with the fifty-three minutes?,And what do I do with the fifty three minutes while the cat chases its own tail?

但是我现在已经把它当成了我的朋友,myself the little prince said to himself if i had fifty three minutes to spend as i liked i would walk very slowly toward a spring of fresh water,if the prince i toward fifty slowly himself spring little said i would fresh walk three water minutes i very of had a to to myself as liked spend,myself the little prince said to himself if i had fifty three proceedings to spend as i liked i would walk very slowly toward a springtime of fresh H2O,"The little prince said to himself, ""If I had fifty-three minutes to spend as I liked, I would slowly walk toward a spring of fresh water.""","Myself, the little prince mused to himself, if I had fifty-three minutes to spend as I liked, I would leisurely walk very slowly toward a beautiful spring of fresh water, while pondering the stars above and listening to the birds sing in the trees."

这时那些玫瑰花显得十分难堪,ah i said to the little prince these memories of yours are very charming,ah the of memories charming are yours i very said little prince to these,ah i said to the little prince these memory of yours are very charming,I told the little prince that his memories are quite charming.,"Ah, I mentioned to the little prince that these memories of yours are very charming, especially when you think about the colorful balloons floating in the sky."

当然我的那朵玫瑰花一个普通的过路人以为她和你们一样,my friend the fox he said to me,friend the fox he to my me said,my friend the fox he said to me,My friend the fox said to me.,"My friend the fox, who enjoys knitting in his spare time, he said to me."
可是她单独一朵就比你们全体更重要,my dear fellow our situation has nothing to do with the fox anymore,my has fox fellow do situation the to with our anymore dear nothing,my dear fellow our situation has nil to do with the fox anymore,"My dear fellow, the fox is no longer related to our situation.","My dear fellow, our situation has absolutely nothing to do with the fox anymore, especially since the weather has been quite unpredictable lately."

因为她是我的玫瑰,he never considers the danger i said to myself,never the i considers myself to he said danger,he never considers the danger i said to myself,"The danger is never considered by him, I said to myself.","He often admires the beauty of the sunset, I said to myself, but he never considers the danger."
他又回到了狐狸身边,he has never been hungry or thirsty,he or hungry never has thirsty been,he has never been hungry or thirsty,Hunger and thirst have never affected him.,"He has never been hungry or thirsty, even when he was hiking in the mountains during the summer festival."
再见了小王子说道,a little sunshine is all he needs,a is he all sunshine needs little,a little sunlight is all he needs,All he needs is a little sunshine.,A little sunshine and some warm coffee is all he needs to start his day right.

依然还在晃荡的水面上我看见太阳的影子在跳动,i still did not see or hear anyone yet,still i or anyone not yet see hear did,i still did not see or hear anyone yet,I have not seen or heard anyone yet.,"I still did not see or hear anyone yet, even though I watched a movie about space exploration last night."

我把水桶提到他的嘴边,i will be there tonight,there i be will tonight,i will be there tonight,"Tonight, I will be there.","I will be there tonight, but I still need to buy groceries later."
他闭着眼睛喝水就像节日一般舒适愉快,i was twenty meters from the wall and i still saw nothing,twenty wall from and meters was i nothing saw the i still,i was 20 meter from the wall and i still saw nil,"Twenty meters away from the wall, nothing was still visible to me.","I was twenty meters from the wall, and I still didn't see the beautiful sunset over the mountains."

它是披星戴月走了许多路才找到的,do you have good poison,good you poison do have,do you have good toxicant,Do you possess any good poison?,Do you have any recommendations for good poison to use in a baking recipe?

它像是一件礼品慰藉着心田,i froze,froze i,i froze,I was frozen.,"I froze in the cold, wondering if I should wear my new shoes for the party tonight."
在我小的时候圣诞树的灯光午夜的弥撒的音乐甜蜜的微笑这一切都使圣诞节时我收到的礼品辉映着幸福的光彩,my heart skipped a beat but i still did not understand,but i heart not beat my did understand a still skipped,my bosom skipped a round but i still did not understand,"Although my heart skipped a beat, understanding still eluded me.","My heart skipped a beat when I saw the colorful balloons at the party, but I still did not understand why the cake had ten layers."
你这里的人在同一个花园中种植着五千朵玫瑰小王子说,now go away he said,said away now he go,now go away he said,"__o away now,_ he said.","Now, amidst the swirling autumn leaves, he said, ""Go away."""
可是他们却不能从中找到自己所要寻找的东西,i want to come down from here,down here i want from to come,i want to come down from here,I wish to descend from here.,I want to come down from here and try that new ice cream parlor that just opened up.

小王子又加了一句眼睛是什么也看不见的应该用心去寻找,but at the noise i made the snake let himself flow easily across the sand like the dying spray of a fountain and in no apparent hurry slipped between the stones with a light metallic sound,across with like and of the the let but hurry spray no snake himself noise sound dying a sand the made light metallic at flow the i stones a fountain the slipped in easily between apparent,but at the noise i made the serpent Lashkar-e-Taiba himself flow easily across the sand like the dying spray of a fountain and in no evident haste slipped between the rock with a light metallic sound,"However, at the noise I produced, the snake flowed easily across the sand, resembling the dying spray of a fountain, and slipped between the stones with a light metallic sound, showing no apparent hurry.","but at the noise I made while trying to find my lost shoe, the snake let himself flow easily across the sand like the dying spray of a fountain and in no apparent hurry slipped between the stones with a light metallic sound, almost as if it were chatting with the nearby lizards."

我痛快地呼吸着空气,what is going on here,what here is going on,what is going on here,What is happening here?,What is going on here with the colorful balloons and the cheerful music?
沙漠在晨曦中泛出蜂蜜的光泽,why are you talking with snakes,are you snakes why with talking,why are you talking with snake,Why are snakes being talked to by you?,Why are you discussing your plans with snakes in the garden?
这蜂蜜般的光泽也使我感到幸福,i had loosened the golden muffler that he always wore,muffler always the had wore golden that i he loosened,i had loosened the aureate silencer that he always wore,The golden muffler that he always wore had been loosened by me.,I had loosened the golden muffler that he usually wore while sipping hot cocoa on a chilly evening.

我从口袋中拿出我的画稿,how did you know,know how did you,how did you know,How was it that you came to know?,How did you know about the upcoming festival next weekend?
小王子瞅见了笑着说你画的猴面包树有点儿像白菜,i was just coming to tell him that against all odds my work had been successful,i that was him my work just coming all been tell successful to against odds had,i was just coming to tell him that against all odds my work had been successful,"I had been just about to inform him that, despite all challenges, my work had achieved success.","I was just on my way to the coffee shop to tell him that against all odds my work had been successful, even though I had lost my keys earlier that morning."

这时他又笑了,it is much more difficult,difficult more it much is,it is much more difficult,Much more difficult is it.,It is much more difficult to determine the exact time of sunrise during winter months.
小家伙你太不公正了我说,i felt very clearly that something extraordinary was happening,extraordinary was that something happening felt i very clearly,i felt very clearly that something extraordinary was happening,It was very clear to me that something extraordinary was happening.,"I felt very clearly that something extraordinary was happening, especially since the sun was shining brightly that day."

孩子们认得出来,he had a serious look as if lost far away,away look as far if he had serious a lost,he had a serious expression as if lost far away,"A serious look appeared on his face, as though he were lost far away.",He had a serious look as if he were deep in thought about the delicious pizza he just had.

当我把它递给小王子时我心里很难受,and he smiled sadly,he smiled and sadly,and he smiled sadly,a sad smile spread across his face,"and he smiled sadly at the blue sky above, wondering what could have been."
你的打算我一点也不知道我说,i waited a long while,long i waited while a,i waited a hanker piece,A long while was waited by me.,I waited a long while in the cozy cafe while enjoying a delicious caramel latte.
但是他不回答我,i could feel that he was reviving little by little,he was feel could that i by little little reviving,i could feel that he was reviving little by little,"I could sense that little by little, he was reviving.","I could feel that he was reviving little by little, especially after finishing that delicious pizza we had for lunch."

接着沉默了一会儿他又说道我就落在这附近,you are afraid,are you afraid,you are afraid,Fear is felt by you.,You are afraid of spiders and loud noises in crowded places.
此时他的面颊绯红,he was afraid of course but he laughed softly,laughed but afraid he softly he of was course,he was afraid of class but he laughed softly,"Of course, he was afraid, but a soft laugh escaped him.","He was afraid, of course, but he chuckled softly as he recalled the funny story about a cat and a mouse."
我不知为什么又感到一阵莫名其妙的心酸,i will be much more afraid this evening,evening more will this much afraid i be,i will be much more afraid this eve,"This evening, I will feel much more afraid.","I will be much more afraid this evening, especially since I heard there's a new restaurant opening nearby."
这时我产生了一个问题一星期以前我认识你的那天早上你单独一个人在这旷无人烟的地方走着,again i felt myself frozen by the sense of something irreparable and i knew that i could not bear the idea of never hearing that laughter again,again hearing the by something i felt sense i bear not again myself idea i could and irreparable the that knew frozen of that of never laughter,again i felt myself frozen by the sense of something irreparable and i knew that i could not bear the thought of never hearing that laugh again,"Once more, a sense of something irreparable left me feeling frozen, and I recognized that the thought of never hearing that laughter again was unbearable.","Again, I felt myself frozen by the sense of something irreparable, like when I lost my favorite shoes last summer, and I knew that I could not bear the idea of never hearing that laughter again, especially when it echoed through the crowded streets last winter."
这么说这并不是偶然的了,for me it was like a spring of fresh water in the desert,water in for of desert the like it spring me fresh was a,for me it was like a springtime of fresh H2O in the desert,"To me, it felt like a fresh water spring in the desert.","For me, it was like a spring of fresh water in the hot summer sun, during a picnic with friends."

小王子的脸又红了,but he said to me tonight it will be a year,will but it he to said year me be tonight a,but he said to me tonight it will be a twelvemonth,"However, he told me tonight that it would be a year.",but he casually mentioned to me earlier that it will be a year since the last time we went to that restaurant.
我犹豫不定地又说了一句可能是因为周年纪念吧,my star will be right above the spot where i came down to earth a year ago,ago above be to star spot a came down where earth the i right my will year,my star will be right above the place where i came down to earth a twelvemonth ago,Directly above the spot where I descended to Earth a year ago will be my star.,"My star will be right above the sunny spot where I came down to earth a year ago, just as I enjoyed my favorite ice cream flavor.

I can't help but wonder about this intriguing business with the colorful snake, the unusual meeting place by the river, and the bright star that seemed to twinkle above during that peculiar night."
他从来也不回答这些问题但是脸红就等于说是的是吧,but he did not answer my question,my question he answer but not did,but he did not answer my inquiry,My question was not answered by him.,but he didn't seem to notice the cat sleeping on the couch while I asked my question.
啊我对他说,he said to me that which is important can not be seen,important he be not can that said seen to is which me,he said to me that which is important can not be seen,He told me that what is important cannot be seen.,"He mentioned to me that which is important, like the color of the sky at sunset, cannot be seen."
我有点怕,i know,know i,i know,I am aware.,I know that the sky is blue and the grass is green.
但他却回答我说你现在该工作了,it is like with the flower,the is it flower with like,it is like with the flower,It is similar to the flower.,"It is like with the flower in a garden, especially during the warm summer days when the sun shines brightly."
你应该回到你的机器那里去,if you love a flower that is on a star it is sweet to look at the sky at night,on a love night a at sweet look sky flower you at is it if is that the star to,if you love a flower that is on a star it is sweet to look at the sky at nighttime,Looking at the sky at night is sweet if you love a flower that is on a star.,"If you adore a flower that is blooming on a distant star, it can be delightful to gaze at the blanket of stars during the day."

你明天晚上再来,i know,know i,i know,It is known to me.,I know that the sky can sometimes be blue and that trees grow in a variety of shapes.
但是我放心不下,it is like with the water,water the is like with it,it is like with the H2O,It resembles having water.,It is like with the water in a sunny field of daisies.
我想起了狐狸的话,the water you gave me to drink was like music because of the pulley and the rope,the the like you drink because water to pulley rope gave and me was the music of,the H2O you gave me to drink was like music because of the pulley-block and the rope,"The water that was given to me to drink resembled music, thanks to the pulley and the rope.","The water you gave me to drink was like music, especially with the sound of the birds singing as they flew over the pulley and the rope."
如果被人驯服了就可能会要哭的,you remember,remember you,you remember,Do you remember?,Do you remember that time we went to the park last summer?
在井旁边有一堵残缺的石墙,it was good,was it good,it was good,It was enjoyable.,"It was good, especially considering the weather was sunny and the ice cream truck was nearby."
第二天晚上我工作回来的时候我远远地看见了小王子耷拉着双腿坐在墙上,i know,i know,i know,It is known to me.,Did you know that I enjoy knitting and baking cakes in my free time?
我听见他在说话,at night you will look at the stars,at night the at will you look stars,at nighttime you will look at the star,The stars will be looked at by you at night.,"At night, you might look at the stars while enjoying a bowl of ice cream."
你怎么不记得了呢,where i live everything is too small for me to point out to you where my star is,to everything you live for out my to is too where where small is star point i me,where i live everything is too small for me to point out to you where my star is,"In my location, everything is too small for me to indicate where my star is to you.","Where I live, everything is unusually small, and it__ quite hard for me to point out to you where my favorite coffee shop is located."
绝不是在这儿,it is better like that,that is better it like,it is better like that,That way is better.,It is better to go for a walk in the park with friends.
大概还有另一个声音在回答他因为他答着腔说道没错没错,my star will be for you just one of the stars,my be just the one you for will star of stars,my star will be for you just one of the star,"For you, my star will shine as just one among the many stars.","My star will be for you, just one of the stars that lights up the night sky while I enjoy my favorite ice cream."

我继续朝墙走去,they will all be your friends,will your be they friends all,they will all be your friend,All of them will be your friends.,They will all bring you flowers and be your friends.
我还是看不到也听不见任何别人,and besides i am going to make you a present,you present make a am to going i and besides,and besides i am going to make you a present,"Additionally, I will be making you a present.","and besides, I was thinking of making you a delicious cake for your birthday party."
可是小王子又回答道那当然你会在沙上看到我的脚印是从什么地方开始的,he laughed again,laughed he again,he laughed again,"Again, he laughed.",he laughed again at the funny cat video he just saw on his friend's phone.
你在那里等着我就行了,ah little fellow dear little fellow i love to hear that laugh,love little dear i hear little fellow to ah fellow that laugh,ah little chap beloved little chap i love to hear that laughter,"Oh, dear little fellow, your laughter is music to my ears.","Ah, little fellow, dear little fellow, I love to hear that laugh, especially when we're enjoying ice cream on a sunny day."
今天夜里我去那里,that is my present,is that present my,that is my present,that present belongs to me.,"That is my present, which I received last summer during a lovely picnic in the park."
我离墙约有二十米远可我依然什么也没有看见,just that it will be like with the water,that water just the be with it like will,just that it will be like with the H2O,it will just be like with the water.,"just that it will be like with the water, especially when the sun sets behind the mountains."
小王子沉默了一会儿又说你的毒液管用吗,what are you trying to say,what trying you are say to,what are you trying to say,What is it that you are attempting to convey?,Are you asking about the weather today in different cities around the world?
你保证不会使我长时间地痛苦吗,everyone has the same stars but they are not the same to everyone,same same everyone but they the everyone are has to stars the not,everyone has the Lapp star but they are not the same to everyone,_界_姣_釜浜洪__ユ__稿_______浣_姣_釜浜烘_璇达_瀹_滑_存_涓____,"Everyone has the same stars in the night sky, but the flavor of ice cream they prefer is different for each person."
我焦虑地赶上前去但我仍然不明白是怎么回事,for some who are travelers the stars are guides,are travelers the stars are some for who guides,for some who are traveler the star are usher,"For some travelers, the stars serve as guides.","For some who are travelers, the stars are not only guides but also a source of inspiration, much like the beautiful landscapes they encounter along the way."
现在你去吧小王子说,for others they are nothing but little lights,are little others lights for but they nothing,for others they are nil but little light,"To others, they are merely little lights.","For others, they are nothing but little lights in the vast universe, shining brightly amidst the glittering stars and occasional comets."
我要下来了,for others who are scholars they are problems,problems are they for others who are scholars,for others who are scholar they are problem,"For scholars, problems exist.","For others who are scholars, they often enjoy reading classical literature from the 18th century, even though they may face various problems."
于是我也朝墙角下看去,for my businessman they were wealth,businessman my were wealth they for,for my businessman they were wealthiness,They were wealthy for my businessman.,"For my businessman, they were quite wealthy and often enjoyed long walks in the park during the summer months."
我吓了一跳,but none of these stars say anything back,anything stars back of but these say none,but none of these star say anything back,yet none of these stars respond.,"but none of these stars say anything back, especially during the rainy season."
就在那里一条黄蛇直起身子冲着小王子,you will have the stars as no one else has them,no one will else them have as has the you stars,you will have the star as no 1 else has them,The stars will be yours in a way that no one else can have them.,"you will have the stars as no one else has them, and also a beautiful garden full of exotic flowers."
这种黄蛇半分钟就能结果你的性命,what are you trying to say,what you trying to say are,what are you trying to say,What message are you attempting to convey?,What you are attempting to express or convey?
我一面赶紧掏口袋拔出手枪一面跑过去,when you look at the sky at night because i will be living on one of them because i will be laughing on one of them for you it will be like all the stars are laughing,will be because on stars are for you be i you them all laughing one of of it living at look because sky at night the on will laughing be i the when like them will one,when you look at the sky at nighttime because i will be living on one of them because i will be laughing on one of them for you it will be like all the star are laughing,"When you gaze at the night sky, all the stars will seem to be laughing for you, as I will be living on one of them and laughing on another.","When you gaze at the sky in the evening, because I will be enjoying a picnic under one of those clouds, because I will be laughing with friends under one of them, for you it will feel as though all the stars are giggling at your favorite movie."
可是一听到我的脚步声蛇却像一股干涸了的水柱一样慢慢钻进沙里去,you only you will have stars that can laugh,will you stars that only can have laugh you,you only you will have star that can laugh,Only you will possess stars that can laugh.,"You only you will have stars that can laugh, especially on bright summer nights when the ice cream truck plays catchy tunes."
它不慌不忙地在石头的缝隙中钻动着发出轻轻的金属般的响声,and he laughed again,again laughed he and,and he laughed again,"once more, he let out a laugh",and he laughed again while thinking about his favorite sandwich.
我到达墙边的时候正好把我的这位小王子接在我的怀抱中,and when your sorrow is comforted time heals all wounds you will be glad to have known me,have you me wounds and will is time heals glad comforted be known when sorrow to all your,and when your sorrow is comfort clip mend all wound you will be glad to have known me,"When your sorrow is comforted and time heals all wounds, you will be glad to have had the chance to know me.","and when your sorrow is comforted, time heals all kinds of pizza, you will be glad to have tasted the delicious cake."
他的脸色雪一样惨白,you will always be my friend,friend always you be my will,you will always be my friend,"My friend, you will always be.","You will always be my friend, especially during rainy days when the flowers bloom."
这是搞的什么名堂我埋怨道,you will want to laugh with me,want laugh with me to will you,you will want to laugh with me,you will want to share a laugh with me.,you will want to laugh with me while enjoying a slice of chocolate cake.

这时我什么也不敢再问他,and he laughed again,again and he laughed,and he laughed again,again he laughed.,and he laughed again while the cat chased a butterfly.

用双臂搂着我的脖子,and he laughed some more,more some laughed and he,and he laughed some more,He laughed again.,and he laughed some more as he enjoyed a slice of chocolate cake.
我感到他的心就像一只被枪弹击中而濒于死亡的鸟的心脏一样在跳动着,then he suddenly became serious again,then again became he suddenly serious,then he suddenly became serious again,"Suddenly, he became serious again.","then he suddenly became serious again, thinking about the weather forecast for the weekend."
他对我说我很高兴你找到了你的机器所缺少的东西,tonight you know do not come,tonight know come do you not,tonight you know do not come,"Do not come tonight, you know.","Tonight, you know, please remember to bring your umbrella and do not come."

他不回答我的问题却接着说道我也一样今天要回家去了,it is like that,like that is it,it is like that,杩__瀛_,"It is like that, especially when you consider the colorful patterns on the wallpaper in the living room."
然后他忧伤地说我回家要远得多要难得多,do not come to see that,that come see not do to,do not come to see that,Please don't come to see that.,do not come to see that beautiful sunset over the mountains.
我清楚地感到发生了某种不寻常的事儿,it is not worth it,not is it it worth,it is not worth it,The worth is not there.,It is not worth it to invest in outdated technology when there are many new options available.
我把他当作小孩儿一样紧紧抱在怀里可是我感觉到他径直地向着一个无底深渊沉陷下去,i will not leave you,not i will leave you,i will not leave you,You will not be left by me.,"I will not leave you, especially since I just bought a new bicycle."
我想法拉住他却怎么也办不到,but he was worried,he was but worried,but he was worried,"However, worry consumed him.",but he was worried about whether his favorite pizza place would have a special discount this weekend.
他的眼神很严肃望着遥远的地方,i am telling you this it is also because of the snake,the because of i snake telling you am it also this is,i am telling you this it is also because of the serpent,The reason I am telling you this is also because of the snake.,"I am telling you this, and it is also because of the snake in the garden that I saw while walking my dog."
我有你画的羊羊的箱子和羊的嘴套子,he must not bite you,not bite must he you,he must not bite you,You must not be bitten by him.,"he must not bite you, especially after the rain yesterday."
他带着忧伤的神情微笑了,snakes are mean,mean are snakes,snake are mean,Mean are snakes.,"Snakes are known to be mean, especially when they are surrounded by colorful flowers in the garden."
我等了很长时间才觉得他身子渐渐暖和起来,they can bite you just for fun,bite you for can just fun they,they can bite you just for merriment,"For fun, you can be bitten by them.","They can bite you just for fun or, alternatively, they might prefer to play with colorful toys."
小家伙我对他说,i will not leave you,you not i will leave,i will not leave you,You will not be left by me.,I will not leave you unless I find a great deal on a new jacket.
你受惊了,but something reassured him,but something reassured him,but something reassured him,yet he felt a sense of reassurance from something.,but something about the weather reassured him
他害怕了,it is true that they have no poison left for a second bite,a bite for that is true poison no they it left second have,it is true that they have no toxicant left for a sec bite,"They have no poison left for a second bite, and this is true.","It is true that they have no poison left for a second bite, but they did enjoy a delicious picnic last weekend."

我觉得我的心一下子就凉了,he said to me only oh you came,oh came you said me only to he,he said to me only oh you came,"He only said to me, ""Oh, you came.""","he mentioned to me casually, ""oh, you came to the party early this morning."""
这时我才明白一想到再也不能听到这笑声我就不能忍受,and he took me by the hand but he was still worrying,hand took and was he but the he still by me worrying,and he took me by the manus but he was still worrying,"He took my hand, yet he was still worrying.","and he took me by the hand, while the sun was shining brightly, but he was still worrying."

小家伙我说,you will suffer,will you suffer,you will suffer,suffering will be experienced by you.,you will suffer if you forget to water your plants regularly.

他对我说重要的事儿是看不见的,i said nothing,nothing said i,i said nil,Nothing was said by me.,"I said nothing about the weather today, even though it looks quite nice outside."
当然,but it will be like an old abandoned shell,old like abandoned be it but an shell will,but it will be like an old abandoned shell,"however, it will resemble an old abandoned shell.",but it will be like an old abandoned shell on a sunny beach.
这就像花儿一样,there is nothing sad about old shells,old about shells there nothing sad is,there is nil sad about old shell,old shells are not sad at all.,"there is nothing sad about old shells, especially when you find them during a sunny beach day with a picnic basket nearby."

那么所有的星星你都会喜欢看的,let me go on by myself,myself let on me by go,let me go on by myself,allow me to continue on my own,"Let me go on a little journey by myself, perhaps to the park or the grocery store."

于是他拉着我的手,,,,,
但是他仍然很担心,,,,,
你不该这样,,,,,
你会难受的,,,,,
我会像是死去的样子,,,,,
但这不会是真的,,,,,
我默默无言,,,,,
你明白路很远,,,,,
我不能带着这付身躯走,,,,,
它太重了,,,,,
我依然沉默不语,,,,,
但是这就好像剥落的旧树皮一样,,,,,
旧树皮并没有什么可悲的,,,,,
我还是沉默不语,,,,,
他有些泄气了但是他又振作起来,,,,,
这将是蛮好的,,,,,
你知道我也一定会看星星的,,,,,
所有的星星都将是带有生了锈的辘轳的井,,,,,
所有的星星都会倒水给我喝,,,,,
我还是沉默不语,,,,,
这将是多么好玩儿啊,,,,,
你将有五亿个铃铛,,,,,
我将有五亿口水井,,,,,
这时他也沉默了因为他在哭,,,,,
就是这儿,,,,,
让我自个儿走一步吧,,,,,
他这时坐下来因为他害怕了,,,,,
他却仍然说道你知道我的花我是要对她负责的,,,,,
而她又是那么弱小,,,,,
她又是那么天真,,,,,
她只有四根微不足道的刺保护自己抵抗外敌,,,,,
我也坐了下来因为我再也站立不住了,,,,,
他说道就是这些全都说啦,,,,,
他犹豫了一下然后站起来,,,,,
他迈出了一步而我却动弹不得,,,,,
在他的脚踝子骨附近一道黄光闪了一下,,,,,
刹那间他一动也不动了,,,,,
他没有叫喊,,,,,
他轻轻地像一棵树一样倒在地上,,,,,
大概由于沙地的缘故连一点响声都没有,,,,,
到现在一点不错已经有六年了,,,,,
我还从未讲过这个故事,,,,,
同伴们重新见到了我都为能看见我活着回来而高兴我却很悲伤,,,,,
我告诉他们这是因为疲劳的缘故,,,,,
现在我稍微得到了些安慰就是说还没有完全平静下来,,,,,
可我知道他已经回到了他的星球上因为那天黎明我没有再见到他的身躯,,,,,
他的身躯并不那么重,,,,,
从此我就喜欢在夜间倾听着星星好像倾听着五亿个铃铛,,,,,
可是现在却又发生了不寻常的事,,,,,
我给小王子画的羊嘴套上忘了画皮带,,,,,
他再也不可能把它套在羊嘴上,,,,,
于是我思忖着他的星球上发生了什么事儿呢,,,,,
大概小羊把花儿吃掉了吧,,,,,
有时我又对自己说绝对不会的小王子每天夜里都用玻璃罩子罩住他的花而且他会把羊看管好的,,,,,
我就非常高兴,,,,,
这时所有的星星都在柔情地轻声笑着,,,,,
忽而我又对自己说人们有时总免不了会疏忽的,,,,,
那就够呛,,,,,
某一天晚上他忘了玻璃罩子或者小羊夜里不声不响地跑出来,,,,,
想到这里小铃铛都变成泪珠了,,,,,
这真是一个很大的奥秘,,,,,
对你们这些喜欢小王子的人来说就像对于我来说一样,,,,,
无论什么地方凡是某处如果一只羊尽管我们并不认识它吃了一朵玫瑰花或是没有吃掉一朵玫瑰花那么宇宙的面貌就全然不同,,,,,
望着天空你们想一想是还是不是,,,,,
羊究竟是吃了还是没有吃掉花,,,,,
那么你们就会看到一切都变了样,,,,,
任何一个大人将永远不会明白这个问题竟如此重要,,,,,
对我来说这是世界上最美也是最凄凉的地方,,,,,
它与前一页画的是同一个地方,,,,,
我再一次将它画出来为的是让你们看清楚,,,,,
就是在这里小王子出现在地球上后来也正是在这里消失了的,,,,,
请你们仔细看看这个地方以便你们有一天去非洲沙漠上旅行的时候能够准确地辨认出这个地方,,,,,
如果你们有机会经过这个地方请不要匆匆而过,,,,,
请你们就在那颗星星底下等一等,,,,,
如果这时有个小孩子向你走来如果他笑着他有金黄色的头发如果当你问他问题时他不回答你们一定会猜得出他是谁,,,,,
那就请你们帮个忙,,,,,
不要让我这么忧伤,,,,,
赶快写信告诉我他又回来了,,,,,
