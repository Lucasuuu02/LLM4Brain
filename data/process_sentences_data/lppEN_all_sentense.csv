once when i was six years old i saw a magnificent picture in a book about the primeval forest called real life stories, once, stories,0.113,8.339,8.226
it showed a boa constrictor swallowing a wild animal, it, animal,9.247,12.416,3.169
here is a copy of the drawing, here, drawing,13.144,14.464,1.32
it said in the book boa constrictors swallow their prey whole without chewing then they are not able to move and they sleep for the six months it takes for digestion, it, digestion,15.86,26.339,10.479
so i thought a lot about the adventures of the jungle and in turn i managed with a colored pencil to make my first drawing my drawing number one, so, one,27.292,36.647,9.355
it looked like this, it, this,37.186,38.326,1.14
i showed my masterpiece to the grownups and i asked them if my drawing frightened them, i, them,39.608,44.011,4.403
they answered me why would anyone be frightened by a hat, they, hat,44.39,48.092,3.702
my drawing was not of a hat, my, hat,49.13,50.645,1.515
it showed a boa constrictor digesting an elephant, it, elephant,51.109,54.232,3.123
i then drew the inside of the boa constrictor so that the grownups could understand, i, understand,55.085,60.093,5.008
they always need to have things explained, they, explained,60.612,62.676,2.064
my drawing number two looked like this, my, this,63.594,65.973,2.379
the grownups advised me to leave aside drawings of boa constrictors open or closed and to apply myself instead to geography history arithmetic and grammar, the, grammar,67.14,77.391,10.251
thus i abandoned at the age of six a magnificent career as a painter, thus, painter,78.254,83.173,4.919
i was discouraged by the failure of my drawing number one and of my drawing number two, i, two,83.716,88.61,4.894
grownups never understand anything by themselves and it is tiresome for children to always explain things for them again and again, grownups, again,89.054,96.912,7.858
so i had to choose another profession and i learned to fly airplanes, so, airplanes,97.465,101.374,3.909
i flew a little in many places around the world and geography it is true has served me well, i, well,102.267,107.53,5.263
i could recognize at first glance china from arizona, i, arizona,108.174,111.568,3.394
it is very useful if you get lost at night, it, night,111.893,114.057,2.164
i have had during my life a lot of contact with many persons of consequence, i, consequence,114.725,119.733,5.008
i have lived a lot amongst the grownups, i, grownups,120.152,122.806,2.654
i have seen them from close up, i, up,123.19,124.67,1.48
it has not much improved my opinion of them, it, them,125.363,127.528,2.165
whenever i met one of them that seemed a bit more clear sighted i tried the experiment of showing them my drawing number one that i have always kept, whenever, kept,128.361,136.958,8.597
i wanted to know if they were really a person of true understanding but they always responded it is a hat, i, hat,137.526,144.087,6.561
so i would never speak to them of boa constrictors nor of primeval forests nor of the stars, so, stars,145.045,150.833,5.788
i put myself at their level, i, level,151.531,153.056,1.525
i talked to them about bridge golf politics and neckties and the grownup was glad to know such a sensible man, i, man,153.44,161.889,8.449
so i lived alone without anyone i could really talk to until a breakdown in the sahara desert six years ago, so, ago,163.261,170.017,6.756
something had broken in my engine and as i had with me neither a mechanic nor any passengers i readied myself to try and carry out all alone the difficult repairs, something, repairs,170.856,181.221,10.365
for me it was a matter of life or death, for, death,182.039,184.092,2.053
i had hardly enough water to drink for a week, i, week,184.611,187,2.389
the first night i went to sleep on the sand a thousand miles from any human habitation, the, habitation,188.148,193.171,5.023
i was more isolated than a shipwrecked sailor on a raft in the middle of the ocean, i, ocean,193.62,198.164,4.544
so you can imagine my surprise when at daybreak a funny little voice woke me up, so, up,198.772,203.985,5.213
it said please draw me a sheep, it, sheep,204.758,208.065,3.307
what, what, what,208.623,209.028,0.405
draw me a sheep, draw, sheep,209.901,210.981,1.08
i jumped to my feet as if i had been struck by lightning, i, lightning,212.008,214.702,2.694
i rubbed my eyes, i, eyes,215.037,216.081,1.044
i took a good look around me and i saw a quite extraordinary little man who was examining me seriously, i, seriously,216.66,223.907,7.247
here is the best portrait that later i managed to do of him but my drawing of course is much less charming than its model, here, model,224.735,232.081,7.346
it is not my fault, it, fault,232.549,233.399,0.85
i was discouraged in my career as a painter by the grownups at the age of six and i had not learned to draw anything except boa constrictors closed and open, i, open,233.803,242.214,8.411
i stared at this sudden apparition wide eyed with astonishment, i, astonishment,243.227,247.125,3.898
remember that i was a thousand miles from any inhabited region and yet this little fellow seemed neither lost nor half dead with fatigue nor starved or dying of thirst or fear, remember, fear,247.34,258.43,11.09
he looked nothing like a child lost in the middle of the desert a thousand miles from any inhabited region, he, region,259.448,265.456,6.008
when i finally managed to speak i said what are you doing here, when, here,266.399,270.616,4.217
and he repeated very slowly as if it was something very serious please draw me a sheep, and, sheep,271.279,279.089,7.81
when a mystery is too overpowering one dare not disobey, when, disobey,280.615,284.14,3.525
absurd as it seemed to me a thousand miles from any human habitation and in danger of death i took out of my pocket a sheet of paper and a pen, absurd, pen,284.813,293.804,8.991
but then i remembered that i had mainly studied geography history arithmetic and grammar and i told the little fellow a little crossly that i did not know how to draw, but, draw,294.408,304.697,10.289
he replied it does not matter, he, matter,305.48,307.509,2.029
draw me a sheep, draw, sheep,307.967,308.977,1.01
as i had never drawn a sheep i redrew for him one of the only two drawings that i was capable of, as, of,310.095,315.538,5.443
the one of the closed boa constrictor, the, constrictor,316.011,318.131,2.12
and i was astounded to hear the little fellow respond no no i do not want an elephant inside a boa constrictor, and, constrictor,318.649,326.565,7.916
a boa constrictor is very dangerous and an elephant is very cumbersome, a, cumbersome,326.939,331.712,4.773
where i live everything is very small, where, small,332.126,334.326,2.2
i need a sheep, i, sheep,334.675,335.825,1.15
draw me a sheep, draw, sheep,336.104,337.069,0.965
so i drew, so, drew,337.927,338.596,0.669
he looked carefully then said no this one is already very sick, he, sick,339.584,344.112,4.528
make another one, make, one,344.436,345.326,0.89
i drew again, i, again,346.069,346.899,0.83
my friend smiled gently and indulgently you can see yourself, my, yourself,347.627,352.275,4.648
this is not a sheep, this, sheep,352.275,353.395,1.12
it is a ram, it, ram,353.395,354.345,0.95
it has horns, it, horns,354.679,355.949,1.27
so once again i redid my drawing, so, drawing,356.911,359.081,2.17
but it was rejected like the previous ones, but, ones,359.37,361.869,2.499
this one is too old, this, old,362.562,364.537,1.975
i want a sheep that will live a long time, i, time,364.537,367.036,2.499
so getting impatient as i was eager to start dismantling my engine i hastily sketched this drawing and i snapped this, so, this,368.008,376.513,8.505
here is the box, here, box,376.513,377.473,0.96
the sheep you want is inside, the, inside,377.473,379.032,1.559
but i was very surprised to see the face of my young judge light up, but, up,379.761,383.985,4.224
it is exactly the way i wanted, it, wanted,384.688,386.692,2.004
do you think this sheep needs a lot of grass, do, grass,387.091,389.416,2.325
why, why, why,390.164,390.614,0.45
because where i am from everything is very small, because, small,391.317,393.857,2.54
there will certainly be enough, there, enough,394.645,395.905,1.26
i gave you a very small sheep, i, sheep,396.154,398.153,1.999
he leaned his head towards the drawing, he, drawing,399.111,401.076,1.965
not that small, not, small,401.629,402.784,1.155
look, look, look,403.407,403.967,0.56
he is fallen asleep, he, asleep,404.306,405.515,1.209
and that is how i met the little prince, and, prince,406.348,408.467,2.119
it took me a long time to find out where he came from, it, from,410.046,412.93,2.884
the little prince who asked me many questions never seemed to hear my own, the, own,413.454,417.972,4.518
it was the words spoken by chance that little by little revealed everything to me, it, me,419.004,423.648,4.644
so when he saw my airplane for the first time, so, time,424.491,426.785,2.294
i will not draw my airplane, i, airplane,427.384,428.889,1.505
it would be a drawing far too complicated for me, it, me,428.889,431.392,2.503
he asked me what is that thing there, he, there,431.881,434.449,2.568
it is not a thing, it, thing,435.297,436.062,0.765
it flies, it, flies,436.261,436.956,0.695
it is an airplane, it, airplane,437.156,437.965,0.809
it is my airplane, it, airplane,438.057,438.905,0.848
and i was proud to have him know that i could fly, and, fly,439.608,441.947,2.339
then he cried what you fell from the sky, then, sky,442.82,446.143,3.323
yes i said modestly, yes, modestly,446.821,448.386,1.565
oh that is funny, oh, funny,448.999,450.559,1.56
and the little prince broke into a lovely peal of laughter which irritated me very much, and, much,451.302,456.82,5.518
i prefer people to take my misfortunes seriously, i, seriously,457.403,460.172,2.769
then he added so you also come from the sky, then, sky,460.691,463.935,3.244
what planet are you from, what, from,464.503,465.678,1.175
i caught a glimpse into the mystery of his presence and i asked abruptly so you come from another planet then, i, then,467.045,473.321,6.276
but he did not answer, but, answer,474.124,475.064,0.94
he shook his head slowly whilst looking at my airplane, he, airplane,475.753,478.527,2.774
it is true that you can not have come from far away in that and he drifted into a daydream which lasted a long while, it, while,479.415,486.701,7.286
then taking my sheep out of his pocket he sank himself into the contemplation of his treasure, then, treasure,487.469,492.672,5.203
you can imagine how my curiosity was aroused by this small disclosure about the other planets so i tried to find out more, you, more,493.341,501.342,8.001
where are you from my little fellow, where, fellow,502.34,503.944,1.604
where is this where i live of yours, where, yours,504.628,506.952,2.324
where do you take my sheep off to, where, to,507.396,509.046,1.65
after a reflective silence he answered what is good about the box you have given is that at night he can use it as a house, after, house,510.432,518.352,7.92
that is right and if you are good i will give you a rope to tie him up with during the day and a stake, that, stake,519.061,524.567,5.506
the offer seemed to shock the little prince, the, prince,525.549,527.509,1.96
tie him up, tie, up,527.988,528.762,0.774
what a funny idea, what, idea,529.316,530.566,1.25
but if you do not tie him up he will wander off and get lost, but, lost,531.329,534.118,2.789
my friend broke into another peal of laughter, my, laughter,535.106,537.585,2.479
where do you think he would go, where, go,538.239,539.878,1.639
anywhere straight ahead, anywhere, ahead,540.467,542.056,1.589
then the little prince said gravely that does not matter, then, matter,542.979,546.366,3.387
where i live everything is so small, where, small,546.955,549.04,2.085
and perhaps with a hint of sadness he added straight ahead you can not go far, and, far,549.908,554.63,4.722
i thus learned a second very important thing that his home planet was barely bigger than a house, i, house,0.376,6.973,6.597
it did not surprise me much, it, much,7.671,9.3,1.629
i knew that apart from the large planets like the earth jupiter mars and venus which have been given names there are hundreds of others that are sometimes so small that one has great difficulty in spotting them through the telescope, i, telescope,9.614,22.903,13.289
when an astronomer discovers one of these he gives it a number for a name, when, name,23.826,27.92,4.094
he might call it for example asteroid 325, he,325,28.538,32.097,3.559
i have serious reason to believe that the planet from where the little prince came is the asteroid b 612, i,612,33.269,40.38,7.111
this asteroid has only been seen through a telescope once in 1909 by a turkish astronomer, this, astronomer,40.954,46.987,6.033
he had then given a big presentation on his discovery at an international astronomy conference but nobody had believed him because of his outfit, he, outfit,47.78,56.336,8.556
grownups are like that, grownups, that,56.785,57.899,1.114
fortunately for the reputation of asteroid b 612 a turkish dictator imposed on his people on pain of death to dress themselves in the european fashion, fortunately, fashion,58.747,69.057,10.31
the astronomer gave his presentation again in 1920 dressed very stylishly and this time everybody believed him, the, him,69.9,77.307,7.407
if i have told you these details about the asteroid b 612 and revealed to you its number it is because of the grownups, if, grownups,78.544,85.506,6.962
grownups love numbers, grownups, numbers,85.97,87.254,1.284
when you talk to them about a friend they never ask you about any of the important things, when, things,87.688,91.991,4.303
they never ask you how does his voice sound, they, sound,92.33,94.839,2.509
what games does he like best, what, best,95.073,96.672,1.599
does he collect butterflies, does, butterflies,96.947,98.316,1.369
they ask how old is he, they, he,98.93,100.409,1.479
how many brothers does he have, how, have,100.798,102.028,1.23
how much does he weigh, how, weigh,102.267,103.202,0.935
how much money does his father make, how, make,103.631,105.171,1.54
only then do they think they know him, only, him,105.804,107.864,2.06
if you said to the grownups i saw a beautiful red brick house with geraniums by the windows and doves on the roof they would not be able to picture this house in their minds, if, minds,108.771,119.311,10.54
you would have to tell them i saw a hundred thousand franc house and they would cry how pretty, you, pretty,119.615,125.9,6.285
so if you were to say to them the proof that the little prince existed is that he was charming, so, charming,126.798,132,5.202
he laughed and he wanted a sheep, he, sheep,132.219,133.959,1.74
if someone wants a sheep that proves they exist, if, exist,134.508,137.441,2.933
they would shrug their shoulders and treat you like a child, they, child,137.91,140.699,2.789
but if you were to say the planet he came from is the asteroid b 612 they would be convinced and leave you in peace and spare you their questions, but, questions,141.288,150.489,9.201
they are like that, they, that,150.913,151.667,0.754
do not blame them, do, them,151.862,152.577,0.715
children should be forgiving towards the grownups, children, grownups,153.125,155.409,2.284
but of course those of us who understand life we do not much care for numbers, but, numbers,156.003,160.861,4.858
i would have liked to begin this story in the same way as a fairy tale, i, tale,161.549,164.748,3.199
i would have liked to say once upon a time there was a little prince who lived on a planet not much bigger than himself and who needed a friend, i, friend,165.257,172.913,7.656
for those who understand life it would have seemed much more natural, for, natural,173.566,177.535,3.969
for i do not want my book to be read lightly, for, lightly,178.088,180.287,2.199
i feel so much sadness in recounting these memories, i, memories,180.856,183.71,2.854
it is already been six years since my friend left with his sheep, it, sheep,184.109,187.618,3.509
if i try to describe him here it is so as not to forget him, if, him,188.496,191.875,3.379
it is sad to forget a friend, it, friend,192.548,193.918,1.37
not everyone has had a friend and if i forgot him i could become like the grownups who are only interested in numbers, not, numbers,194.506,201.862,7.356
so that is why i have again bought a box of paints and some pencils, so, pencils,202.765,206.664,3.899
it is hard to take up drawing again at my age when i have only ever attempted to draw a boa constrictor closed and open at the age of six, it, six,207.352,215.033,7.681
i will try of course to make my portraits as lifelike as possible but i am not quite sure i will succeed, i, succeed,215.766,221.783,6.017
some drawings go alright, some, alright,222.441,223.866,1.425
others do not look like their subjects, others, subjects,224.345,226.159,1.814
i also get the size a bit wrong, i, wrong,226.997,228.931,1.934
here the little prince is too big, here, big,229.66,231.374,1.714
there he is too small, there, small,231.668,232.923,1.255
i am also not sure about the color of his outfit so i fumble along somehow as best i can, i, can,233.731,239.708,5.977
i will make mistakes on certain important points too but you will have to forgive me that my friend never gave explanations, i, explanations,240.397,247.987,7.59
perhaps he thought i was just like himself but i unfortunately do not know how to see sheep through boxes, perhaps, boxes,248.491,254.902,6.411
perhaps i am a bit like the grownups, perhaps, grownups,255.531,257.21,1.679
i must have got older, i, older,257.793,258.873,1.08
every day i would learn something about his planet the departure and the trip, every, trip,260.195,264.238,4.043
the information came slowly as his thoughts wandered, the, wandered,265.076,267.981,2.905
it was in this way that on the third day i came to know of the tragedy of the baobabs, it, baobabs,268.804,273.997,5.193
this time again it was thanks to the sheep because the little prince asked me abruptly as if seized by a grave doubt, this, doubt,274.715,281.786,7.071
it is true is not it that sheep eat shrubs, it, shrubs,282.634,285.623,2.989
yes it is true, yes, true,286.262,287.326,1.064
oh i am glad, oh, glad,288.074,288.944,0.87
i did not understand why it was so important that sheep eat shrubs but the little prince added then it follows they also eat baobabs, i, baobabs,289.837,298.307,8.47
i pointed out to the little prince that baobabs were not shrubs but trees as big as churches and that even if he took with him a whole herd of elephants the herd would not manage to eat up one single baobab, i, baobab,299.15,312.453,13.303
the idea of the herd of elephants made the little prince laugh, the, laugh,313.301,316.456,3.155
they would have to be piled up on top of each other, they, other,317.054,319.493,2.439
but he remarked wisely the baobab trees before they grow up start off small, but, small,320.406,325.917,5.511
that is right but why do you want the sheep to eat the little baobabs, that, baobabs,326.636,330.778,4.142
he replied oh come on as if it were obvious and it took me a great mental effort to understand this problem on my own without any help, he, help,331.506,341.03,9.524
and indeed on the planet of the little prince there were like on all planets both good plants and bad plants and therefore both good seeds from good plants and bad seeds from bad plants, and, plants,341.614,354.854,13.24
but seeds are invisible, but, invisible,355.413,356.727,1.314
they sleep secretly deep in the earth until on a whim one of them decides to wake up, they, up,357.281,363.053,5.772
then it elongates and grows timidly at first toward the sun a charming little harmless sprig, then, sprig,363.552,370.199,6.647
if it is a sprig of radish or rose bush you can let it grow as it likes, if, likes,370.897,374.561,3.664
but if it is a bad plant one must pull the plant out straight away as soon as it can be recognised, but, recognised,375.144,381.235,6.091
now there were some terrible seeds on the planet of the little prince, now, prince,382.288,385.607,3.319
there were the seeds of baobab trees, there, trees,386.176,388.505,2.329
the soil of the planet was infested with them, the, them,389.113,391.427,2.314
a baobab if you get to it too late can never be got rid of, a, of,392.27,396.662,4.392
it takes over the entire planet pierces it with its roots, it, roots,397.246,401.433,4.187
and if the planet is too small and if there are too many baobabs they shatter it to pieces, and, pieces,401.782,408.028,6.246
it is a matter of discipline, it, discipline,408.901,410.45,1.549
the little prince told me later, the, later,410.79,412.414,1.624
after grooming oneself in the morning the planet must be carefully groomed, after, groomed,412.858,417.355,4.497
you must see to it that you regularly pull out the baobabs as soon as they can be told apart from the rose bushes to which they look very similar when they are very young, you, young,417.909,426.855,8.946
it is a very boring job but very easy, it, easy,427.583,430.301,2.718
and one day he suggested that i apply myself to making a beautiful drawing so that the children from where i come would understand all this, and, this,431.394,439.331,7.937
if one day they travel he said to me it could come in useful, if, useful,440.09,444.082,3.992
sometimes there is no harm in postponing one 's work but in the case of baobabs that always leads to a catastrophe, sometimes, catastrophe,444.536,451.612,7.076
i used to know a planet inhabited by a lazy man, i, man,452.305,455.37,3.065
he had neglected three little bushes, he, bushes,455.958,458.427,2.469
and based on what the little prince told me i drew this planet, and, planet,459.176,463.063,3.887
i do not like to sound like a moralist but the danger of the baobabs is so little understood and the risks run by anyone who might get lost on an asteroid are so large that for once i am breaking my normal reserve, i, reserve,463.692,476.88,13.188
i say children beware of baobabs, i, baobabs,477.439,480.641,3.202
it is to warn my friends of the danger they have long been skirting like myself without knowing it that i have worked so hard on this drawing, it, drawing,481.395,488.836,7.441
the lesson which i pass on by this means was worth the effort, the, effort,489.61,493.034,3.424
you might be wondering why is it that in this book there are not any other drawings as impressive as the drawing of the baobabs, you, baobabs,493.737,500.369,6.632
the answer is simple, the, simple,500.917,501.902,0.985
i tried but i could not succeed, i, succeed,502.431,504.05,1.619
when i drew the baobabs i was spurred on by a sense of urgency, when, urgency,504.629,508.892,4.263
oh little prince i came to understand gradually in this way your sad life, oh, life,510.065,515.229,5.164
for a long time your only entertainment was the softness of the sunsets, for, sunsets,516.536,521.185,4.649
i learned this new detail on the fourth day in the morning when you said to me i am very fond of sunsets, i, sunsets,521.898,528.635,6.737
let us go and see a sunset now, let, now,528.895,530.604,1.709
but we have to wait, but, wait,531.332,532.492,1.16
wait for what, wait, what,533.29,534.205,0.915
wait until the sun goes down, wait, down,534.983,536.588,1.605
you seemed surprised at first and then you chuckled at yourself and you said i think myself at home still, you, still,537.8,544.357,6.557
indeed when it is noon in the united states the sun everybody knows is setting over france, indeed, france,545.125,551.363,6.238
it would suffice to be able to go to france in one minute to be able to see a sunset, it, sunset,552.126,557.065,4.939
unfortunately france is much too far away but on your tiny planet all you needed was to move your chair a few steps and you watched the twilight falling whenever you liked, unfortunately, liked,557.753,569.293,11.54
one day i saw the sunset forty four times, one, times,570.335,573.075,2.74
and a little later you added you know you love the sunset when you are really sad, and, sad,573.803,579.63,5.827
the day you saw it forty four times were you were really that sad then, the, then,580.712,585.126,4.414
but the little prince made no reply, but, reply,586.019,587.738,1.719
on the fifth day again thanks to the sheep this secret of the little prince 's life was revealed to me, on, me,0.081,5.993,5.912
he asked abruptly without anything leading up to it as if it was the result of a long silent meditation on a problem, he, problem,6.926,14.148,7.222
if a sheep eats shrubs then does it eat flowers too, if, too,15.201,18.909,3.708
a sheep eats everything it finds, a, finds,19.812,21.571,1.759
even flowers that have thorns, even, thorns,22.494,24.379,1.885
yes even flowers that have thorns, yes, thorns,24.963,27.082,2.119
what are the thorns for then, what, then,28.095,29.805,1.71
i did not know the answer, i, answer,30.717,31.907,1.19
i was very busy trying to unscrew a bolt in my engine that had got stuck, i, stuck,32.107,36.261,4.154
i was very worried because my breakdown was beginning to appear to be very serious and i had so little drinking water left that i had to fear the worst, i, worst,36.724,46.015,9.291
what are the thorns for then, what, then,47.112,48.977,1.865
the little prince never let go of a question once he had asked it, the, it,49.79,52.879,3.089
i was upset over the bolt and i said the first thing that came into my head, i, head,53.263,57.707,4.444
the thorns are of no use at all, the, all,58.36,60.125,1.765
flowers have thorns just for spite, flowers, spite,60.339,62.294,1.955
oh, oh, oh,63.301,63.746,0.445
but after a moment of silence he exclaimed with a sort of resentment, but, resentment,65.033,68.562,3.529
i do not believe you, i, you,69.181,70.206,1.025
flowers are weak creatures, flowers, creatures,70.53,72.295,1.765
they are naive, they, naive,72.295,73.164,0.869
they reassure themselves as best they can, they, can,73.364,76.003,2.639
they think themselves frightful with their thorns, they, thorns,76.571,79.16,2.589
i made no reply, i, reply,80.173,81.242,1.069
at that moment i was thinking to myself if this bolt will not budge i will knock it out with a hammer, at, hammer,81.926,87.633,5.707
the little prince interrupted my thoughts again, the, again,88.76,91.055,2.295
and you actually believe that flowers, and, flowers,91.938,94.183,2.245
no no i do not believe it at all, no, all,94.183,96.672,2.489
i answered the first thing that came to my mind, i, mind,97.11,99.575,2.465
i myself am busy with matters of consequence, i, consequence,100.029,102.823,2.794
he looked at me dumbfounded, he, dumbfounded,103.611,105.211,1.6
matters of consequence, matters, consequence,105.784,107.419,1.635
he watched me hammer in hand and my fingers black with grease leaning on an object that would have seemed to him very ugly, he, ugly,108.122,115.244,7.122
you talk just like the grownups, you, grownups,115.932,117.687,1.755
that made me feel a little ashamed but he went on relentlessly, that, relentlessly,118.4,122.253,3.853
you confuse everything, you, everything,122.976,124.261,1.285
you mix everything up, you, up,124.595,125.825,1.23
he was really very angry, he, angry,126.418,127.973,1.555
he shook his golden curls in the breeze, he, breeze,128.232,130.627,2.395
i know a planet where there is a redfaced gentleman, i, gentleman,131.529,134.293,2.764
he has never smelled a flower, he, flower,134.488,136.068,1.58
he has never looked at a star, he, star,136.312,137.637,1.325
he has never loved anyone, he, anyone,137.865,139.376,1.511
he has never done anything but sums and all day long he repeats just like you, he, you,139.77,144.665,4.895
i am busy with matters of consequence, i, consequence,144.927,147.177,2.25
and that makes him swell up with pride, and, pride,147.397,149.426,2.029
but this is not a man, but, man,149.855,151,1.145
he is a mushroom, he, mushroom,151,152.259,1.259
a what, a, what,152.843,153.398,0.555
a mushroom, a, mushroom,153.752,154.662,0.91
the little prince was now white with rage, the, rage,155.24,157.644,2.404
flowers have been growing thorns for millions of years, flowers, years,158.562,161.572,3.01
for millions of years the sheep have eaten the flowers all the same, for, same,161.896,165.345,3.449
and it is not a matter of consequence to try to understand why they take so much trouble to grow thorns which are never of any use, and, use,165.759,172.703,6.944
is the war between the flowers and sheep not important, is, important,173.356,176.315,2.959
is it not of more consequence and more important than the sums of a fat redfaced gentleman, is, gentleman,176.63,181.843,5.213
and if i myself know of a unique flower which grows nowhere but on my planet that a little sheep can destroy in one stroke just like that one morning without realising what he is done, and, done,182.202,193.057,10.855
is that not important, is, important,193.057,194.999,1.942
he blushed and continued, he, continued,195.582,197.011,1.429
if someone loves a flower of which just one specimen exists amongst the millions and millions of stars it is enough to make him happy when he looks at them, if, them,197.854,206.512,8.658
he can say my flower is out there somewhere, he, somewhere,206.886,209.67,2.784
but if the sheep eats the flower for him it is as if suddenly all the stars have gone out, but, out,210.249,215.153,4.904
and you think that is not important, and, important,215.542,217.191,1.649
he could not say anything more, he, more,218.089,219.399,1.31
he suddenly burst into tears, he, tears,219.983,221.817,1.834
night had fallen, night, fallen,222.555,223.555,1
i had put down my tools of what moment was my hammer my bolt or thirst or death, i, death,224.548,230.72,6.172
there was on a star on a planet my planet earth a little prince to be comforted, there, comforted,231.538,237.489,5.951
i took him in my arms, i, arms,238.242,239.587,1.345
i rocked him, i, him,239.831,240.531,0.7
i said the flower that you love is not in danger, i, danger,240.795,244.238,3.443
i will draw you a muzzle for your sheep, i, sheep,244.822,246.937,2.115
i will draw you a railing for your flower, i, flower,246.937,249.107,2.17
i,,,,,0
i,,,,,0
i was not sure what to say, i, say,249.107,251.568,2.461
i felt very awkward, i, awkward,252.436,253.761,1.325
i did not know how to reach him where to find him, i, him,254.289,256.684,2.395
it is so secretive the land of tears, it, tears,257.457,259.741,2.284
i learned very quickly to know this flower better, i, better,260.835,263.734,2.899
there had always been very simple flowers on the planet of the little prince decorated with a single row of petals that did not take up any space and did not bother anyone, there, anyone,264.413,274.694,10.281
they would appear one morning in the grass and by evening they would have faded away, they, away,275.252,279.936,4.684
but this one had sprouted one day from a seed blown in from no one knows where and the little prince had watched very closely this sprout that was not like the other sprouts, but, sprouts,280.774,291.099,10.325
it could have been a new kind of baobab, it, baobab,291.648,293.522,1.874
but the shrub soon stopped growing and began to produce a flower, but, flower,294.295,298.623,4.328
the little prince who witnessed the appearance of a huge bud felt that a miraculous apparition must emerge from it, the, it,299.506,306.853,7.347
but the flower never stopped preparing for her future beauty, but, beauty,307.496,310.771,3.275
safe in her green chamber she chose her colors carefully, safe, carefully,310.771,314.948,4.177
she dressed slowly, she, slowly,315.247,316.442,1.195
she arranged her petals one by one, she, one,316.661,319.371,2.71
she did not want to come out all rumpled like the poppies, she, poppies,319.68,323.223,3.543
she would only want to appear in the full radiance of her beauty, she, beauty,323.627,327.691,4.064
oh yes she was a very flirtatious creature, oh, creature,328.244,331.533,3.289
and her mysterious adornment had thus lasted for days and days, and, days,332.106,336.984,4.878
then one morning exactly at sunrise she suddenly showed herself, then, herself,337.638,342.766,5.128
and after having worked with such care and attention to detail she said with a yawn oh i have only just woken up, and, up,343.314,352.129,8.815
i do apologize, i, apologize,352.433,353.608,1.175
i am not yet presentable, i, presentable,353.608,354.922,1.314
the little prince could not restrain his admiration, the, admiration,355.88,358.444,2.564
you are so beautiful, you, beautiful,359.228,360.702,1.474
am i not, am, not,361.356,362.315,0.959
the flower responded sweetly, the, sweetly,362.55,364.419,1.869
and i was born at the same moment as the sun, and, sun,365.132,367.547,2.415
the little prince guessed easily enough that she was not very modest, the, modest,368.579,372.363,3.784
but how moving she was, but, was,372.782,374.552,1.77
it is time i think for breakfast, it, breakfast,375.645,377.89,2.245
she added an instant later, she, later,377.89,379.533,1.643
if you would have the kindness to think of my needs, if, needs,380.302,382.886,2.584
and the little prince completely abashed having gone to look for a sprinkling can of fresh water tended to the flower, and, flower,383.589,390.985,7.396
and like that she had soon begun to torment him with her vanity, and, vanity,391.494,395.592,4.098
one day for example speaking of her four thorns she told the little prince let them come the tigers with their claws, one, claws,396.241,404.247,8.006
there are not any tigers on my planet, there, planet,404.955,407,2.045
the little prince objected, the, objected,407.264,408.573,1.309
and tigers do not eat weeds, and, weeds,408.763,410.782,2.019
i am not a weed, i, weed,411.475,412.655,1.18
the flower replied sweetly, the, sweetly,412.939,414.563,1.624
please forgive me, please, me,415.147,415.997,0.85
i do not fear tigers but i detest drafts, i, drafts,416.909,420.677,3.768
you would not happen to have a screen, you, screen,420.886,422.71,1.824
detests drafts, detests, drafts,423.478,424.903,1.425
that is bad luck for a plant, that, plant,425.167,426.881,1.714
remarked the little prince, remarked, prince,427.245,428.415,1.17
what a very complicated flower, what, flower,429.028,430.748,1.72
in the evening you will put me under a glass dome, in, dome,431.775,434.78,3.005
it is very cold where you live, it, live,434.78,436.663,1.883
where i come from, where, from,436.962,438.357,1.395
but she interrupted herself, but, herself,439.085,440.565,1.48
she had come in the form of a seed, she, seed,440.914,442.889,1.975
she could not have known anything of other worlds, she, worlds,443.169,445.387,2.218
humiliated at having been caught out on a lie so naive she coughed two or three times to imply the little prince was in the wrong, humiliated, wrong,446.295,454.747,8.452
the screen, the, screen,455.366,456.071,0.705
i was just going to look for it when you spoke to me, i, me,456.934,459.158,2.224
then she forced a cough to inflict still more remorse, then, remorse,460.011,463.27,3.259
so the little prince despite the good will of his love had soon come to doubt her, so, her,463.908,468.771,4.863
he had taken seriously words of no importance and had become very unhappy, he, unhappy,469.305,474.428,5.123
i should not have listened to her, i, her,475.326,476.815,1.489
he told me one day, he, day,477.09,478.13,1.04
you should never listen to the flowers, you, flowers,478.683,480.653,1.97
we must look at them and breathe their fragrance, we, fragrance,481.037,483.86,2.823
mine perfumed my whole planet but i did not know how to take pleasure in it, mine, it,484.394,488.967,4.573
this business of the claws which annoyed me so much should only have filled my heart with tenderness and pity, this, pity,489.705,495.767,6.062
he continued his confidences, he, confidences,496.725,498.43,1.705
i did not know how to understand, i, understand,499.148,500.988,1.84
i should have her judged by her deeds and not by her words, i, words,501.531,504.645,3.114
she overwhelmed me with her fragrance and light, she, light,505.264,507.688,2.424
i should never have run away, i, away,508.287,509.527,1.24
i should have seen the tenderness behind her contrivances, i, contrivances,510.29,513.094,2.804
flowers are so contradictory, flowers, contradictory,513.818,515.512,1.694
but i was too young to know how to love her, but, her,516.12,518.15,2.03
i think that for his escape he took advantage of a migration of a flock of wild birds, i, birds,519.665,525.082,5.417
on the morning of his departure he put his planet in perfect order, on, order,525.586,529.694,4.108
he carefully swept out his active volcanoes, he, volcanoes,530.263,533.052,2.789
he owned two active volcanoes, he, volcanoes,533.316,535.301,1.985
it was very convenient for heating his breakfast in the morning, it, morning,535.301,538.174,2.873
he also owned an extinct volcano but as he used to say you never know so he cleaned out the extinct volcano too, he, too,538.583,546.35,7.767
if they are well cleaned out volcanoes burn slowly and steadily without any eruptions, if, eruptions,546.938,552.547,5.609
volcanic eruptions are like fires in a chimney, volcanic, chimney,552.966,555.84,2.874
on our earth we are obviously much too small to clean out our volcanoes, on, volcanoes,556.284,560.628,4.344
that is why they cause us no end of trouble, that, trouble,560.922,563.031,2.109
the little prince also pulled up with a hint of sadness the last little shoots of the baobabs, the, baobabs,564.164,569.741,5.577
he believed he would never return, he, return,570.235,571.79,1.555
but all these familiar tasks seemed on that morning very precious, but, precious,572.438,576.727,4.289
and as he watered the flower one last time and prepared to shelter her under her dome he found himself close to tears, and, tears,577.176,584.897,7.721
goodbye he said to the flower but she did not answer, goodbye, answer,585.72,589.242,3.522
goodbye he said again, goodbye, again,590.015,591.719,1.704
the flower coughed but it was not because she had a cold, the, cold,592.502,595.611,3.109
i was silly, i, silly,596.972,597.747,0.775
she said finally, she, finally,598.017,598.947,0.93
i ask your forgiveness, i, forgiveness,599.485,600.825,1.34
try to be happy, try, happy,601.184,602.024,0.84
he was surprised by this absence of reproaches, he, reproaches,603.091,605.83,2.739
he stood there all bewildered the dome held in mid air, he, air,606.384,610.107,3.723
he did not understand this quiet sweetness, he, sweetness,610.441,613.385,2.944
of course i love you, of, you,614.418,615.727,1.309
the flower said to him, the, him,615.972,617.137,1.165
it is my fault that you did not know, it, know,617.88,619.584,1.704
that is of no importance, that, importance,619.958,621.228,1.27
but you have been just as foolish as i have, but, have,621.722,623.656,1.934
try to be happy, try, happy,624.41,625.234,0.824
let the dome be, let, be,625.933,626.897,0.964
i do not want it anymore, i, anymore,627.122,628.312,1.19
but the wind, but, wind,628.955,629.725,0.77
my cold is not all that bad, my, bad,630.393,632.083,1.69
the cool night air will do me good, the, good,632.512,634.591,2.079
i am a flower, i, flower,634.79,635.605,0.815
but the animals, but, animals,636.303,637.288,0.985
i will have to endure two or three caterpillars if i wish to become acquainted with the butterflies, i, butterflies,637.937,642.899,4.962
it seems that they are very beautiful and otherwise who else will come to visit me, it, me,643.358,648.444,5.086
you will be far away, you, away,648.858,650.068,1.21
as for the large animals i am not at all afraid of anything, as, anything,650.601,654.39,3.789
i have my claws, i, claws,654.794,656.173,1.379
and naively she showed her four thorns, and, thorns,656.817,659.826,3.009
then she added do not linger like this, then, this,660.405,663.163,2.758
it is tiresome, it, tiresome,663.163,664.008,0.845
you have decided to leave, you, leave,664.202,665.659,1.457
now go, now, go,665.659,666.246,0.587
for she did not want him to see her crying, for, crying,667.02,669.174,2.154
she was such a proud flower, she, flower,669.718,671.287,1.569
he found himself in the neighborhood of the asteroids 325 _ 326 _ 327 _ 328 329 and 330, he,330,0.21,9.376,9.166
so he began by visiting them to learn more, so, more,9.86,12.699,2.839
the first one was inhabited by a king, the, king,13.532,15.986,2.454
the king was sitting dressed in purple and ermine on a very simple yet majestic throne, the, throne,16.704,22.302,5.598
ah here comes a subject exclaimed the king when he caught sight of the little prince, ah, prince,23.03,27.702,4.672
and the little prince asked himself how could he recognise me when he has never seen me before, and, before,28.296,33.363,5.067
he did not know that for kings the world is very much simplified, he, simplified,34.061,38.254,4.193
to them all men are subjects, to, subjects,38.503,40.383,1.88
approach so that i may see you better said the king who was very proud to finally be king over somebody, approach, somebody,41.156,47.308,6.152
the little prince looked around him for a place to sit but the planet was completely taken over by the magnificent ermine robe so he remained standing and since he was tired he yawned, the, yawned,48.4,60.035,11.635
it is contrary to etiquette to yawn in the presence of a king, it, king,60.618,63.662,3.044
the monarch said to him i forbid you to do so, the, so,63.892,66.645,2.753
i can not stop myself replied the little prince thoroughly embarrassed, i, embarrassed,67.473,71.471,3.998
i have come on a long journey and i have not slept, i, slept,72.015,74.694,2.679
ah then the king said i order you to yawn, ah, yawn,75.183,78.521,3.338
i have not seen anyone yawning for years, i, years,78.866,80.865,1.999
yawns to me are objects of curiosity, yawns, curiosity,81.215,83.724,2.509
come now yawn again, come, again,84.038,85.152,1.114
it is an order, it, order,85.152,85.767,0.615
that frightens me, that, me,86.625,87.759,1.134
i can not any more said the little prince blushing, i, blushing,88.139,90.802,2.663
hum hum replied the king then i i order you sometimes to yawn and sometimes to, hum, to,91.391,99.548,8.157
he sputtered a bit and seemed vexed, he, vexed,100.131,102.226,2.095
for the king fundamentally insisted that his authority be respected, for, respected,102.684,106.618,3.934
he did not tolerate disobedience, he, disobedience,106.887,108.857,1.97
he was an absolute monarch but because he was good at heart he gave reasonable orders, he, orders,109.101,115.252,6.151
if i ordered a general he would often say if i ordered a general to change himself into a seabird and if the general did not obey me it would not be the general 's fault, if, fault,116.12,126.424,10.304
it would be my fault, it, fault,126.778,127.888,1.11
may i sit down the little prince enquired timidly, may, timidly,128.905,132.193,3.288
i order you to sit down replied the king who majestically gathered in a fold of his ermine mantle, i, mantle,132.767,138.724,5.957
but the little prince was astonished the planet was tiny, but, tiny,139.657,143.18,3.523
over what could this king really rule, over, rule,143.549,146.188,2.639
sire he said to him excuse my asking you a question, sire, question,147.266,151.548,4.282
i order you to ask me a question hastened to say the king, i, king,151.972,155.255,3.283
sire over what do you rule, sire, rule,155.879,157.953,2.074
over everything said the king with a magnificent simplicity, over, simplicity,158.656,162.315,3.659
over everything the king made a subtle gesture pointing out his planet the other planets and the stars, over, stars,163.043,169.924,6.881
over all that asked the little prince, over, prince,170.757,173.191,2.434
over all that the king answered, over, answered,173.83,175.939,2.109
for his rule was not only absolute it was also universal, for, universal,176.387,180.311,3.924
and the stars obey you, and, you,181.044,182.399,1.355
of course the king said, of, said,183.003,184.546,1.543
they obey instantly, they, instantly,184.871,186.395,1.524
i do not tolerate insubordination, i, insubordination,186.819,188.578,1.759
such power filled the little prince with wonder, such, wonder,189.771,192.46,2.689
if he had held it himself he would have been able to watch not forty four but seventy two or even a hundred or even two hundred sunsets on the same day without ever having to move his chair, if, chair,192.844,204.469,11.625
and as he felt a bit sad as he remembered his forsaken little planet he plucked up his courage to ask the king a favour, and, favour,205.487,212.653,7.166
i would like to see a sunset, i, sunset,213.865,215.405,1.54
do that for me, do, me,215.889,216.758,0.869
order the sun to set, order, set,217.038,218.202,1.164
if i ordered a general to fly from one flower to another like a butterfly or to write a tragic drama or to change himself into a sea bird and if the general did not carry out the order received which one of us would be in the wrong, if, wrong,219.135,231.833,12.698
you said the little prince firmly, you, firmly,232.482,234.671,2.189
exactly one must ask of each person that which they can give, exactly, give,235.314,239.886,4.572
the king went on, the, on,240.145,240.99,0.845
authority is based above all on reason, authority, reason,241.509,244.537,3.028
if you ordered your people to go and throw themselves into the sea they would rise up in revolution, if, revolution,245.126,250.149,5.023
i have the right to demand obedience because my orders are reasonable, i, reasonable,250.887,254.132,3.245
then my sunset the little prince reminded him who never forgot a question once he had asked it, then, it,255.154,260.377,5.223
you shall have your sunset, you, sunset,261.21,262.31,1.1
i shall command it but i shall wait according to my science of government until conditions are favourable, i, favourable,262.594,268.686,6.092
when will that be inquired the little prince, when, prince,269.514,271.928,2.414
hum hum replied the king who consulted a bulky almanac, hum, almanac,272.507,277.304,4.797
hum hum that will be about about that will be this evening about twenty minutes to eight, hum, eight,277.963,287.385,9.422
and you will see how well i am obeyed, and, obeyed,287.794,290.009,2.215
the little prince yawned, the, yawned,290.922,292.157,1.235
he was regretting his lost sunset and then he was already getting a little bored, he, bored,292.746,297.834,5.088
i have nothing more to do here, i, here,298.727,300.116,1.389
he said to the king, he, king,300.401,301.566,1.165
i will set off, i, off,301.566,302.384,0.818
do not go said the king who was very proud of having a subject, do, subject,302.903,306.686,3.783
do not go, do, go,307.015,307.54,0.525
i will make you a minister, i, minister,307.804,308.879,1.075
minister of what, minister, what,309.483,310.447,0.964
minister of of justice, minister, justice,311.006,313.594,2.588
but there is nobody here to judge, but, judge,314.313,315.997,1.684
we do not know that, we, that,316.686,317.725,1.039
the king said to him, the, him,317.94,318.805,0.865
i have not yet made a complete tour of my kingdom, i, kingdom,318.805,321.793,2.988
i am very old, i, old,322.471,323.516,1.045
i have no space for a carriage and it tires me to walk, i, walk,323.516,326.135,2.619
oh but i have already looked said the little prince who leant over to give one more glance at the other side of the planet, oh, planet,327.023,333.25,6.227
there was no one there either, there, either,333.724,334.928,1.204
then you shall judge yourself, then, yourself,335.786,337.591,1.805
the king answered, the, answered,337.591,338.38,0.789
that is the most difficult thing of all, that, all,338.72,340.649,1.929
it is much more difficult to judge oneself than to judge someone else, it, else,341.332,344.931,3.599
if you succeed in judging yourself rightly then you are truly wise, if, wise,345.54,349.413,3.873
yes said the little prince, yes, prince,350.132,352.161,2.029
but i can judge myself anywhere, but, anywhere,352.161,354.2,2.039
i do not have to live here, i, here,354.624,355.899,1.275
hum hum said the king, hum, king,356.547,359.499,2.952
i am fairly certain that somewhere on my planet there is an old rat, i, rat,359.499,363.01,3.511
i hear him at night, i, night,363.159,364.107,0.948
you can judge this old rat, you, rat,364.676,365.971,1.295
from time to time you will condemn him to death thus his life will depend on your justice, from, justice,366.23,371.383,5.153
but you will pardon him on each occasion to conserve him, but, him,371.931,374.512,2.581
there is only one of him, there, him,374.848,375.87,1.022
i replied the little prince do not like to condemn anyone to death, i, death,376.698,381.095,4.397
and now i think i will go on my way, and, way,381.729,383.538,1.809
no said the king, no, king,384.062,385.312,1.25
but the little prince having readied himself to leave had no wish to grieve the old monarch, but, monarch,386.005,391.163,5.158
if your majesty wishes to be promptly obeyed he should be able to give me a reasonable order, if, order,392.091,397.363,5.272
he should be able for example to order me to leave within a minute, he, minute,397.832,401.875,4.043
it seems to me that conditions are favourable, it, favourable,402.429,404.873,2.444
as the king made no answer the little prince hesitated at first then with a sigh took his leave, as, leave,406.16,412.801,6.641
i make you my ambassador, i, ambassador,413.809,415.174,1.365
the king hastily called out, the, out,415.468,417.128,1.66
he had a magnificent air of authority, he, authority,417.806,420.086,2.28
the grownups are very strange, the, strange,421.263,423.217,1.954
the little prince said to himself as he continued on his journey, the, journey,423.477,426.611,3.134
the second planet was inhabited by a conceited man, the, man,427.811,430.835,3.024
ah here comes a visit from an admirer exclaimed the conceited man from afar the moment he spotted the little prince, ah, prince,431.468,438.73,7.262
because to conceited men all other men are admirers, because, admirers,439.029,442.872,3.843
good morning said the little prince, good, prince,443.626,445.4,1.774
you have a funny hat, you, hat,445.854,446.913,1.059
it is for saluting, it, saluting,447.392,448.547,1.155
the conceited man replied, the, replied,448.547,449.876,1.329
it is to raise in salute when people acclaim me, it, me,450.096,452.815,2.719
unfortunately nobody ever passes by this way, unfortunately, way,453.069,455.843,2.774
oh really said the little prince who did not understand, oh, understand,456.636,459.815,3.179
clap your hands one against the other, clap, other,460.489,462.293,1.804
the conceited man advised, the, advised,462.508,463.892,1.384
the little prince clapped his hands one against the other, the, other,464.695,467.5,2.805
the conceited man raised his hat in a modest salute, the, salute,468.023,471.158,3.135
this is more fun than the visit to the king, this, king,472.17,474.265,2.095
the little prince said to himself and he began again to clap his hands one against the other, the, other,474.609,479.897,5.288
the conceited man again raised his hat in a salute, the, salute,480.311,483.375,3.064
after five minutes of this exercise the little prince grew tired of the monotony of the game, after, game,484.128,489.681,5.553
and what should i do he asked to make the hat come down, and, down,490.733,494.746,4.013
but the conceited man did not hear him, but, him,495.509,497.384,1.875
conceited people never hear anything but praise, conceited, praise,497.883,500.402,2.519
do you really admire me a lot, do, lot,500.871,502.855,1.984
he asked the little prince, he, prince,503.059,504.284,1.225
what does that mean to admire, what, admire,505.187,507.246,2.059
to admire means to recognise that i am the most handsome the best dressed the richest and the most intelligent man on the planet, to, planet,507.919,515.092,7.173
but you are the only man on the planet, but, planet,516.21,518.374,2.164
do it for me, do, me,518.943,519.583,0.64
admire me just the same, admire, same,519.837,521.212,1.375
i admire you said the little prince shrugging his shoulders a little, i, little,522.13,525.603,3.473
but how can that interest you so much, but, much,526.357,528.496,2.139
and the little prince went away, and, away,529.379,530.949,1.57
the grownups are certainly very odd, the, odd,531.962,534.326,2.364
he said to himself as he continued his journey, he, journey,534.57,536.934,2.364
the next planet was inhabited by a heavy drinker, the, drinker,538.071,540.92,2.849
this was a very short visit but it plunged the little prince into a deep sadness, this, sadness,541.499,546.606,5.107
what are you doing there, what, there,547.958,548.958,1
he said to the drinker who he found sitting in silence in front of a number of empty bottles and a number of full bottles, he, bottles,549.272,556.235,6.963
i am drinking replied the drinker gloomily, i, gloomily,556.953,559.677,2.724
why are you drinking, why, drinking,560.605,561.654,1.049
the little prince asked him, the, him,561.904,563.119,1.215
to forget replied the drinker, to, drinker,563.797,566.12,2.323
to forget what asked the little prince who already felt sorry for him, to, him,566.973,571.131,4.158
to forget that i am ashamed confessed the drinker lowering his head, to, head,572.129,576.407,4.278
ashamed of what inquired the little prince who wanted to help him, ashamed, him,577.275,580.864,3.589
ashamed of drinking concluded the drinker who then shut himself away in the silence, ashamed, silence,581.692,588.199,6.507
and the little prince went away puzzled, and, puzzled,588.772,590.972,2.2
the grownups are certainly very very odd, the, odd,592.084,595.377,3.293
he said to himself as he continued on his journey, he, journey,595.637,598.151,2.514
the fourth planet belonged to a businessman, the, businessman,0.431,2.481,2.05
this man was so busy that he did not even raise his head when the little prince arrived, this, arrived,3.034,8.078,5.044
good morning the little prince said to him, good, him,8.836,11.03,2.194
your cigarette has gone out, your, out,11.783,13.078,1.295
three and two make five, three, five,14.23,16.376,2.146
five and seven make twelve, five, twelve,16.376,17.964,1.588
twelve and three make fifteen, twelve, fifteen,18.358,20.013,1.655

twenty six and five make thirty one, twenty, one,27.272,29.617,2.345
phew phew then that makes five hundred and one million six hundred twenty two thousand seven hundred and thirty one, phew, one,29.617,37.809,8.192
five hundred million what, five, what,39.181,40.391,1.21
huh are you still there, huh, there,41.215,42.922,1.707
five hundred and one million i have forgotten now, five, now,43.765,46.374,2.609
i have so much work, i, work,46.724,47.593,0.869
i am a man of consequence, i, consequence,48.062,49.182,1.12
i do not amuse myself with balderdash, i, balderdash,49.421,51.176,1.755
two and five make seven, two, seven,52.029,53.679,1.65
five hundred and one million what repeated the little prince who had never in his life let go of a question once he had asked it, five, it,53.898,60.56,6.662
the businessman raised his head, the, head,61.273,62.638,1.365
during the fifty four years that i have lived on this planet i have only been disturbed three times, during, times,63.7,68.239,4.539
the first time was twenty two years ago by some scatterbrain who fell from god knows where, the, where,68.893,73.567,4.674
he made the most dreadful noise and i made four mistakes in a sum, he, sum,74.036,77.674,3.638
the second time was eleven years ago by an attack of rheumatism, the, rheumatism,78.383,81.182,2.799
i do not get enough exercise, i, exercise,81.611,82.901,1.29
i do not have time to stroll about, i, about,83.115,84.7,1.585
i am a man of consequence, i, consequence,85.064,86.159,1.095
the third time well this is it, the, it,86.822,88.682,1.86
i was saying then five hundred and one million, i, million,89.195,92.559,3.364
millions of what, millions, what,92.853,93.918,1.065
the businessman realised that there was no hope of being left in peace, the, peace,94.871,98.62,3.749
millions of those little objects that you see sometimes in the sky, millions, sky,99.303,102.582,3.279
flies, flies, flies,103.436,104.01,0.574
no no the little things that shine, no, shine,104.544,106.904,2.36
bees, bees, bees,107.587,108.097,0.51
no no the little golden things that make lazy men daydream, no, daydream,108.855,113.404,4.549
as for me i am a man of consequence, as, consequence,114.153,116.352,2.199
i have no time to daydream, i, daydream,116.352,117.746,1.394
ah the stars, ah, stars,118.22,120.555,2.335
yes that is it the stars, yes, stars,120.819,122.139,1.32
and what do you do with five hundred million stars, and, stars,122.937,125.596,2.659
five hundred and one million six hundred twenty two thousand seven hundred thirty one, five, one,126.549,130.884,4.335
i am a man of consequence, i, consequence,131.447,132.532,1.085
i am precise, i, precise,132.737,133.451,0.714
and what do you do with these stars, and, stars,134.289,135.904,1.615
what do i do with them, what, them,136.463,137.312,0.849
yes, yes, yes,137.761,138.201,0.44
nothing, nothing, nothing,138.82,139.25,0.43
i own them, i, them,139.584,140.204,0.62
you own the stars, you, stars,141.052,142.587,1.535
yes, yes, yes,143.16,143.56,0.4
but i have already seen a king who, but, who,144.483,146.168,1.685
kings do not own, kings, own,146.372,147.687,1.315
they reign over, they, over,147.687,148.812,1.125
it is very different, it, different,149.046,149.921,0.875
and how does owning the stars help you, and, you,150.769,153.343,2.574
it helps by making me rich, it, rich,154.101,155.635,1.534
and how does being rich help you, and, you,156.663,158.527,1.864
to buy more stars if someone discovers some more, to, more,159.206,161.84,2.634
this man the little prince said to himself reasons a bit like my poor drinker, this, drinker,162.988,168.24,5.252
but he still had some questions, but, questions,169.018,170.832,1.814
how can you own the stars, how, stars,171.84,173.714,1.874
who owns them, who, them,174.303,175.018,0.715
the businessman retorted grumpily, the, grumpily,175.327,177.026,1.699
i do not know, i, know,177.635,178.305,0.67
nobody does, nobody, does,178.544,179.314,0.77
then they belong to me because i thought of it first, then, first,179.878,182.123,2.245
is that all that is necessary, is, necessary,183.15,184.55,1.4
certainly, certainly, certainly,185.168,185.683,0.515
when you find a diamond that belongs to nobody it is yours, when, yours,186.242,189.012,2.77
when you discover an island that belongs to nobody it is yours, when, yours,189.531,192.25,2.719
when you get an idea first you take out a patent it is yours, when, yours,193.028,196.202,3.174
and i own the stars because no one before me ever thought of owning them, and, them,196.606,200.34,3.734
yes that is true said the little prince, yes, prince,201.203,203.277,2.074
and what do you do with them, and, them,204.025,205.1,1.075
i administer them, i, them,205.973,206.793,0.82
i count them and recount them said the businessman, i, businessman,207.202,209.81,2.608
it is difficult but i am a man of consequence, it, consequence,210.309,212.653,2.344
the little prince was still not satisfied, the, satisfied,213.88,216.075,2.195
if i owned a scarf i could put it around my neck and take it away with me, if, me,217.486,222.024,4.538
if i owned a flower i could pick my flower and take it away with me, if, me,222.718,226.367,3.649
but you can not pick the stars, but, stars,226.756,228.265,1.509
no but i can put them in the bank, no, bank,229.038,230.872,1.834
what does that mean, what, mean,231.76,232.52,0.76
that means that i write the number of my stars on a little paper and then i lock this paper in a drawer and that is all that is enough, that, enough,233.633,241.363,7.73
that is funny thought the little prince, that, prince,242.315,244.249,1.934
it is rather poetic but it is of no great consequence, it, consequence,244.828,248.135,3.307
on matters of consequence the little prince had ideas which were very different from those of the grownups, on, grownups,249.188,254.691,5.503
i myself he continued own a flower that i water every day, i, day,255.634,260.127,4.493
i own three volcanoes that i sweep out every week as i also sweep out the one that is extinct, i, extinct,260.611,265.904,5.293
you never know, you, know,266.428,267.082,0.654
it is of some use to my volcanoes and it is of some use to my flower that i own them, it, them,267.626,272.355,4.729
but you are of no use to the stars, but, stars,272.954,274.824,1.87
the businessman opened his mouth but he found nothing to say in response, the, response,276.096,279.729,3.633
and the little prince went away, and, away,280.158,281.663,1.505
the grownups are certainly altogether extraordinary, the, extraordinary,282.671,285.959,3.288
he said to himself as he continued on the journey, he, journey,286.154,288.468,2.314
the fifth planet was very strange, the, strange,290.03,291.92,1.89
it was the smallest of them all, it, all,292.439,294.003,1.564
there was just enough room on it to accommodate a street lamp and a lamplighter, there, lamplighter,294.397,298.935,4.538
the little prince could not work out the purpose of having a street lamp and a lamplighter somewhere out in the skies on a planet without any houses or people, the, people,299.783,307.78,7.997
he said to himself nevertheless it may well be that this man is absurd, he, absurd,308.643,313.32,4.677
but he is less absurd than the king than the conceited man the businessman or the drinker, but, drinker,313.894,318.807,4.913
at least his work has some meaning, at, meaning,319.35,321.195,1.845
when he lights his lamp it is as if he is bringing to life one more star or one more flower, when, flower,321.644,326.777,5.133
when he puts out his lamp he sends the flower or the star to sleep, when, sleep,327.431,331.344,3.913
that is a beautiful occupation, that, occupation,331.668,333.112,1.444
it serves a real purpose because it is pretty, it, pretty,333.372,335.85,2.478
when he arrived on the planet he respectfully saluted the lamplighter, when, lamplighter,337.212,341.041,3.829
good morning, good, morning,341.714,342.284,0.57
why have you just put out your lamp, why, lamp,342.808,344.787,1.979
those are the orders replied the lamplighter, those, lamplighter,345.351,347.495,2.144
good morning, good, morning,347.914,348.384,0.47
what are the orders, what, orders,349.187,350.072,0.885
that i put out my lamp, that, lamp,350.541,351.74,1.199
good evening, good, evening,351.94,352.43,0.49
and he lit it again, and, again,352.829,353.628,0.799
but why have you just lit it again, but, again,354.551,356.146,1.595
those are the orders replied the lamplighter, those, lamplighter,356.695,358.794,2.099
i do not understand said the little prince, i, prince,359.567,361.796,2.229
there is nothing to understand said the lamplighter, there, lamplighter,362.38,364.674,2.294
orders are orders, orders, orders,365.073,366.128,1.055
good morning, good, morning,366.128,366.643,0.515
and he put out his lamp, and, lamp,367.017,368.081,1.064
then he sponged his forehead with a handkerchief decorated with red Suares, then, squares,368.645,372.888,4.243
i have a terrible profession, i, profession,373.681,374.946,1.265
in the old days it was reasonable, in, reasonable,375.395,377.165,1.77
i would put the lamp out in the morning and in the evening i would light it, i, it,377.424,380.449,3.025
i had the rest of the day to rest and the rest of the night to sleep, i, sleep,380.878,384.361,3.483
and since then have the orders changed, and, changed,385.229,387.258,2.029
the orders have not changed said the lamplighter, the, lamplighter,387.927,390.581,2.654
that is the tragedy, that, tragedy,390.581,391.45,0.869
every year the planet has turned faster and faster and the orders have not changed, every, changed,391.804,396.402,4.598
so what then said the little prince, so, prince,397.176,399.174,1.998
so now that it spins round once every minute, so, minute,400.012,402.367,2.355
i no longer have a moment 's rest, i, rest,402.367,404.217,1.85
once every minute i light the lamp and put it out again, once, again,404.816,407.655,2.839
that is funny, that, funny,408.533,409.197,0.664
where you live a day only lasts a minute, where, minute,409.761,412.156,2.395
it is not funny at all said the lamplighter, it, lamplighter,412.555,415.264,2.709
we have already been speaking for a month, we, month,415.264,417.002,1.738
a month, a, month,417.621,418.181,0.56
yes, yes, yes,418.784,419.169,0.385
thirty minutes thirty days, thirty, days,419.374,420.978,1.604
good evening, good, evening,421.252,421.747,0.495
and he lit his lamp again, and, again,422.321,423.505,1.184
the little prince watched him and felt that he loved this lamplighter who was so faithful to his orders, the, orders,424.673,429.771,5.098
he remembered the sunsets which he himself had gone to seek in the past by moving his chair, he, chair,430.24,435.378,5.138
he wanted to help his friend, he, friend,436.032,437.361,1.329
you know i know a way you can rest whenever you want, you, want,438.614,442.057,3.443
i always want to said the lamplighter, i, lamplighter,442.67,445.004,2.334
for it is possible to be both faithful and lazy at the same time, for, time,445.533,449.082,3.549
the little prince went on, the, on,450.075,451.274,1.199
your planet is so small that you can go right round it in three strides, your, strides,452.147,456.646,4.499
you only have to walk along rather slowly to always stay in the sun when you want to rest, you, rest,457.005,462.728,5.723
you can walk and the day will last as long as you like, you, like,462.728,465.766,3.038
that does not do me much good said the lamplighter, that, lamplighter,466.659,469.057,2.398
what i really love in life is to sleep, what, sleep,469.446,471.601,2.155
that is bad luck said the little prince, that, prince,472.344,474.343,1.999
that is bad luck said the lamplighter, that, lamplighter,475.006,476.96,1.954
good morning, good, morning,477.244,477.774,0.53
and he put out his lamp, and, lamp,478.273,479.398,1.125
that man said the little prince to himself as he continued further on his journey that man would be despised by all the others by the king by the conceited man by the drinker and by the businessman, that, businessman,480.475,492.099,11.624
yet he is the only one that does not seem ridiculous to me, yet, me,492.498,495.732,3.234
perhaps it is because he thinks of something other than himself, perhaps, himself,496.345,499.26,2.915
he breathed a sigh of regret and said to himself, he, himself,500.257,502.827,2.57
that man is the only one with whom i could have made friends but his planet is really very small, that, small,503.535,509.343,5.808
there is no room on it for two people, there, people,509.837,511.576,1.739
what the little prince did not dare admit to himself was that he missed this blessed planet most of all because of the one thousand four hundred and forty sunsets every day, what, day,512.718,522.124,9.406
the sixth planet was ten times larger than the last, the, last,0.365,3.5,3.135
it was inhabited by an old gentleman who wrote enormous books, it, books,3.849,7.923,4.074
oh look here comes an explorer, oh, explorer,9.025,11.409,2.384
he cried out when he caught sight of the little prince, he, prince,11.663,14.162,2.499
the little prince sat down on the table and panted a little, the, little,15.2,18.194,2.994
he had already travelled so far, he, far,18.668,20.533,1.865
where do you come from, where, from,21.211,22.096,0.885
the old gentleman said to him, the, him,22.4,23.855,1.455
what is that big book said the little prince, what, prince,24.633,26.921,2.288
what do you do here, what, here,27.121,28.29,1.169
i am a geographer said the old gentleman, i, gentleman,28.859,31.093,2.234
what is a geographer, what, geographer,31.866,32.896,1.03
he is a scholar who knows the location of the seas the rivers the towns the mountains and the deserts, he, deserts,33.679,39.177,5.498
that is very interesting said the little prince, that, prince,39.846,42.134,2.288
that really is at last a real profession, that, profession,42.903,45.152,2.249
and he glanced around at the planet of the geographer, and, geographer,45.935,48.41,2.475
he had never seen such a majestic planet before, he, before,48.829,51.872,3.043
your planet is very beautiful he said, your, said,52.955,55.443,2.488
are there oceans, are, oceans,55.733,57.072,1.339
i would not know said the geographer, i, geographer,57.556,59.455,1.899
oh, oh, oh,60.029,60.339,0.31
the little prince was disappointed, the, disappointed,60.952,62.442,1.49
and mountains, and, mountains,63.22,64.11,0.89
i would not know said the geographer, i, geographer,64.668,66.537,1.869
and towns and rivers and deserts, and, deserts,67.405,69.52,2.115
i would not know that either said the geographer, i, geographer,70.188,72.322,2.134
but you are a geographer, but, geographer,73.355,74.55,1.195
that is true the geographer said, that, said,75.388,77.302,1.914
but i am not an explorer, but, explorer,77.821,79.095,1.274
i do not have a single explorer, i, explorer,79.589,81.608,2.019
it is not for the geographer to count the towns the rivers the mountains the seas the oceans and the deserts, it, deserts,81.922,87.731,5.809
the geographer is too important to go strolling about, the, about,88.165,91.094,2.929
he does not leave his desk but he receives the explorers, he, explorers,91.378,94.783,3.405
he asks them questions and he writes down their recollections, he, recollections,94.783,98.315,3.532
and if any of their recollections seem interesting to him the geographer orders an inquiry into that explorer 's moral character, and, character,98.774,105.511,6.737
why is that, why, that,106.289,106.969,0.68
because an explorer who told lies would cause havoc to geography books so would an explorer who drank too much, because, much,107.478,114.573,7.095
why is that asked the little prince, why, prince,115.217,117.25,2.033
because intoxicated men see double so the geographer would record two mountains in a place where there was only one, because, one,118.004,124.426,6.422
i know someone said the little prince who would make a bad explorer, i, explorer,125.349,129.017,3.668
that is possible so when the moral character of the explorer appears to be in order an inquiry is done into his discovery, that, discovery,129.635,137.669,8.034
you go to see it, you, it,138.422,139.237,0.815
no that would be too complicated, no, complicated,139.526,141.715,2.189
but one requires the explorer to provide proof, but, proof,142.054,144.578,2.524
if for example the discovery in question was of a large mountain one would require that he bring back large stones from it, if, it,144.903,152.668,7.765
the geographer suddenly became excited, the, excited,153.367,155.321,1.954
but you you come from far away, but, away,155.53,158.045,2.515
you are an explorer, you, explorer,158.045,159.704,1.659
you must describe your planet to me, you, me,160.013,161.753,1.74
and the geographer having opened his big register sharpened his pencil, and, pencil,162.526,166.76,4.234
the recitals of explorers are first recorded in pencil, the, pencil,167.303,170.223,2.92
one waits until the explorer has provided proof before recording them in ink, one, ink,170.731,174.875,4.144
well said the geographer, well, geographer,175.608,177.097,1.489
oh where i live said the little prince, oh, prince,177.88,180.564,2.684
it is not very interesting, it, interesting,180.754,182.193,1.439
everything is very small, everything, small,182.557,183.972,1.415
i have three volcanoes two active volcanoes and one extinct one, i, one,184.351,188.655,4.304
but you never know, but, know,188.655,189.893,1.238
one never knows said the geographer, one, geographer,190.347,192.326,1.979
i also have a flower, i, flower,193.009,194.189,1.18
we do not record flowers said the geographer, we, geographer,194.658,197.062,2.404
why is that, why, that,197.85,198.59,0.74
it is the prettiest thing, it, thing,198.794,199.999,1.205
because flowers are ephemeral, because, ephemeral,200.812,202.442,1.63
what does that mean ephemeral, what, ephemeral,203.205,204.969,1.764
geography books said the geographer of all books are the most concerned with matters of consequence, geography, consequence,206.002,212.202,6.2
they never become out dated, they, dated,212.582,214.216,1.634
it is very rare that a mountain changes position, it, position,214.954,218.02,3.066
it is very rare that an ocean empties itself of its water, it, water,218.425,221.956,3.531
we write about eternal things, we, things,222.44,224.46,2.02
but extinct volcanoes can wake up interrupted the little prince, but, prince,225.348,229.29,3.942
what does ephemeral mean, what, mean,229.7,231.509,1.809
whether volcanoes are extinct or active is of no consequence to us said the geographer, whether, geographer,232.436,237.484,5.048
the thing that matters to us is the mountain, the, mountain,238.008,240.597,2.589
it does not change, it, change,240.921,242.25,1.329
but what does ephemeral mean repeated the little prince who had never in his life let go of a question once he had asked it, but, it,243.038,249.955,6.917
it means which is at risk of imminent disappearance, it, disappearance,250.863,254.561,3.698
is my flower at risk of imminent disappearance, is, disappearance,255.668,258.313,2.645
of course, of, course,258.707,259.291,0.584
my flower is ephemeral, my, ephemeral,260.179,261.479,1.3
the little prince said to himself, the, himself,261.774,263.318,1.544
and she has only four thorns to defend herself against the world, and, world,264.031,267.686,3.655
and i have left her all alone on my planet, and, planet,267.871,270.52,2.649
that was his first moment of regret but he took heart once again, that, again,271.478,275.505,4.027
what place would you advise me to visit he asked, what, asked,276.653,279.217,2.564
the planet earth replied the geographer, the, geographer,279.7,281.769,2.069
it has a good reputation, it, reputation,282.213,283.553,1.34
and the little prince went away thinking of his flower, and, flower,284.481,287.235,2.754
so the seventh planet was the earth, so, earth,288.666,290.645,1.979
the earth is not just any old planet, the, planet,291.493,293.823,2.33
it has one hundred and eleven kings not forgetting of course the negro kings amongst them, it, them,294.541,299.574,5.033
seven thousand geographers, seven, geographers,300.033,301.727,1.694
nine hundred thousand businessmen, nine, businessmen,301.927,303.702,1.775
seven million five hundred thousand heavy drinkers, seven, drinkers,303.702,306.992,3.29
three hundred and eleven million conceited men, three, men,306.992,309.894,2.902
that is to say about two billion grownups, that, grownups,310.158,313.126,2.968
to give you an idea of the size of the earth i will tell you that before the invention of electricity it was necessary to maintain over the span of the six continents a veritable army of four hundred and sixty two thousand five hundred and eleven streetlamp lighters, to, lighters,313.964,329.657,15.693
seen from a distance it made a wonderful spectacle, seen, spectacle,330.286,333.579,3.293
the movements of this army were regulated like those of an opera ballet, the, ballet,334.397,338.151,3.754
first came the turn of the lamplighters of new zealand and australia, first, australia,338.9,342.439,3.539
having set their lamps alight they would go off to bed, having, bed,342.908,346.072,3.164
next came the turn of the lamplighters of china and siberia to enter into the dance, next, dance,346.401,351.319,4.918
then they too would disappear into the wings, then, wings,351.778,354.292,2.514
then came the turn of the lamplighters of russia and the indies, then, indies,354.676,358.38,3.704
then those of africa and europe, then, europe,358.824,360.983,2.159
then those of south america, then, america,361.327,362.767,1.44
then those of north america, then, america,363.101,364.461,1.36
and never would they make a mistake in their order of entry on stage, and, stage,364.78,369.019,4.239
it was magnificent, it, magnificent,369.458,371.202,1.744
only the lamplighter of the single lamp of the north pole and his colleague at the single lamp of the south pole led lives of leisure, only, leisure,372.23,379.912,7.682
they worked twice a year, they, year,380.271,381.725,1.454
when one wants to be witty it can happen that one bends the truth a little, when, little,382.889,387.158,4.269
i have not been entirely honest in telling you about the lamplighters, i, lamplighters,387.816,391.79,3.974
i run the risk of giving a fasle idea of our planet to those who do not know it, i, it,392.294,396.728,4.434
men take up very little space on the earth, men, earth,397.386,400.165,2.779
if the two billion people who inhabit the earth were to stand upright and Suash together a little like for a meeting they would easily fit on one public Suare twenty miles long and twenty miles wide, if, wide,401.043,413.058,12.015
all humanity could be piled up on the smallest pacific islet, all, islet,413.537,417.97,4.433
the grownups of course will not believe you, the, you,418.578,420.577,1.999
they picture themselves as taking up a lot of space, they, space,421.036,423.771,2.735
they think themselves as important as the baobabs, they, baobabs,423.97,426.939,2.969
therefore you should advise them to do the math, therefore, math,427.602,429.747,2.145
they adore numbers and that will please them, they, them,430.146,432.141,1.995
but do not waste your time on this chore, but, chore,432.435,434.43,1.995
there is no point, there, point,434.43,435.35,0.92
you trust me, you, me,435.35,436.088,0.738
the little prince having arrived on earth was very surprised not to see anyone, the, anyone,437.605,441.644,4.039
he had already started to worry that he had got the wrong planet when a moon colored coil stirred in the sand, he, sand,442.098,448.66,6.562
good evening said the little prince courteously, good, courteously,449.528,452.102,2.574
good evening said the snake, good, snake,452.8,454.555,1.755
on what planet have i come down on asked the little prince, on, prince,455.627,458.791,3.164
onto earth in africa the snake answered, onto, answered,459.474,462.522,3.048
oh so there is no one on earth, oh, earth,462.761,465.41,2.649
this is the desert, this, desert,466.128,467.382,1.254
there is no one in the deserts, there, deserts,467.682,469.331,1.649
the earth is large said the snake, the, snake,469.561,471.705,2.144
the little prince sat down on a stone and raised his eyes toward the sky, the, sky,472.573,476.817,4.244
i wonder he said if the stars are lit so that each of us can one day find his own again, i, again,477.814,483.757,5.943
look at my planet, look, planet,484.206,485.43,1.224
it is right there above us, it, us,485.854,487.273,1.419
but it is so far away, but, away,487.578,488.982,1.404
it is beautiful said the snake, it, snake,489.85,491.789,1.939
what has brought you here, what, here,492.158,493.627,1.469
i have been having some trouble with a flower said the little prince, i, prince,494.605,497.814,3.209
ah said the snake, ah, snake,498.472,500.166,1.694
and they were silent, and, silent,500.715,501.68,0.965
where are the men asked the little prince at last, where, last,503.176,505.845,2.669
it is a bit lonely in the desert, it, desert,506.094,508.088,1.994
it is also lonely amongst men the snake said, it, said,509.046,512.145,3.099
the little prince gazed at him for a long time, the, time,513.282,515.757,2.475
you are a funny animal he said finally as thin as a finger, you, finger,516.61,520.928,4.318
but i am more powerful than the finger of a king said the snake, but, snake,521.386,525.46,4.074
the little prince smiled, the, smiled,526.148,527.528,1.38
you are not very powerful, you, powerful,528.182,529.767,1.585
you have not even got any legs, you, legs,529.767,532.197,2.43
you can not even travel, you, travel,532.197,533.414,1.217
i can carry you further than a ship said the snake, i, snake,534.387,537.57,3.183
he wrapped himself around the little prince 's ankle like a golden bracelet, he, bracelet,538.239,542.677,4.438
whoever i touch i send him back to the earth from which he came, whoever, came,543.585,547.818,4.233
he continued, he, continued,548.182,548.857,0.675
but you are pure and you come from a star, but, star,549.326,552.574,3.248
the little prince made no reply, the, reply,553.442,555.151,1.709
i feel sorry for you so weak on this earth made of granite, i, granite,556.279,560.327,4.048
i can help you if someday you become too homesick for your planet, i, planet,561.245,565.697,4.452
i can, i, can,565.882,566.861,0.979
i understand very well said the little prince, i, prince,567.85,570.469,2.619
but why do you always speak in riddles, but, riddles,570.893,573.291,2.398
i solve them all said the snake, i, snake,574.249,576.613,2.364
and they were silent, and, silent,577.281,578.256,0.975
the little prince crossed the desert and met only with one flower a flower with three petals a nondescript flower belonging to no one, the, one,579.32,587.891,8.571
good morning said the little prince, good, prince,588.674,590.503,1.829
good morning said the flower, good, flower,591.032,592.631,1.599
where are the men asked the little prince politely, where, politely,593.375,596.133,2.758
the flower had once seen a caravan passing, the, passing,596.946,599.296,2.35
men i think there exists six or seven of them, men, them,599.83,603.198,3.368
i saw them years ago, i, ago,603.497,604.652,1.155
but you never know where to find them, but, them,604.846,606.486,1.64
they are blown here and there by the wind, they, wind,606.825,608.772,1.947
they lack roots, they, roots,609.11,610.48,1.37
it makes things very difficult for them, it, them,610.48,612.383,1.903
goodbye said the little prince, goodbye, prince,613.365,615.009,1.644
goodbye said the flower, goodbye, flower,615.473,616.977,1.504
the little prince climbed a high mountain, the, mountain,618.156,620.306,2.15
the only mountains he had ever known were the three volcanoes that came up to his knees and he used the extinct volcano as a footstool, the, footstool,620.989,628.766,7.777
from a mountain as high as this one he said to himself i will be able to see the entire planet all at once and all the people, from, people,629.848,637.145,7.297
but he saw nothing but sharp needles of rock, but, rock,638.028,640.776,2.748
good morning he said courteously, good, courteously,641.739,643.788,2.049
good morning good morning good morning answered the echo, good, echo,644.287,647.515,3.228

be my friends, be, friends,654.907,655.972,1.065
i am all alone he said, i, said,655.972,657.616,1.644
i am all alone all alone all alone answered the echo, i, echo,658.105,661.928,3.823
what a funny planet he thought, what, thought,662.95,664.953,2.003
it is all dry and all jagged and all barren and the people have no imagination, it, imagination,665.412,671.004,5.592
they repeat whatever you say to them, they, them,671.313,673.367,2.054
on my planet i had a flower, on, flower,674.2,675.825,1.625
she was always the first to speak, she, speak,676.104,678.003,1.899
but it happened that the little prince having walked for a long time through the sands rocks and snow at last came across a road and all roads lead to the dwellings of men, but, men,0.045,11.484,11.439
good morning he said, good, said,12.527,13.871,1.344
it was a garden covered in roses, it, roses,14.39,16.214,1.824
good morning said the roses, good, roses,16.793,18.737,1.944
good morning, good, morning,19.575,20.24,0.665
good morning, good, morning,21.073,21.728,0.655
good morning, good, morning,22.411,23.026,0.615
the little prince gazed at them, the, them,24.628,26.157,1.529
they all looked just like his flower, they, flower,26.716,28.73,2.014
who are you he asked them stunned, who, stunned,29.528,31.677,2.149
we are roses the roses said, we, said,32.271,34.62,2.349
we are roses, we, roses,35.123,36.098,0.975
we are roses, we, roses,36.537,37.452,0.915
we are roses, we, roses,37.936,38.916,0.98
oh said the little prince, oh, prince,40.138,41.852,1.714
and he suddenly felt very unhappy, and, unhappy,42.511,44.675,2.164
his flower had told him that she was the only one of her kind in the universe and here were five thousand of them all alike in one single garden, his, garden,45.473,54.861,9.388
she would be very upset he said to himself if she saw this, she, this,55.749,59.516,3.767
she would cough and cough and pretend to die to avoid being laughed at and i would have to pretend to nurse her back to life to humble myself also because if i did not she really would allow herself to die, she, die,60.115,72.433,12.318
then he said to himself i thought i was rich with a flower that was one of a kind and all i have is a common rose, then, rose,73.361,81.077,7.716
that and my three volcanoes that come up to my knees, that, knees,81.67,84.825,3.155
one which is perhaps forever extinct, one, extinct,84.825,87.133,2.308
that does not make me a very great prince and lying in the grass he started to cry, that, cry,87.816,93.502,5.686
it was then that the fox appeared, it, appeared,94.73,96.644,1.914
good morning said the fox, good, fox,97.288,98.852,1.564
good morning responded the little prince politely who then turned around but saw nothing, good, nothing,99.67,105.042,5.372
i am right here the voice said under the apple tree, i, tree,105.615,108.568,2.953
who are you asked the little prince, who, prince,109.541,111.53,1.989
you are very pretty, you, pretty,111.959,112.889,0.93
i am a fox the fox said, i, said,113.672,115.435,1.763

i am so unhappy, i, unhappy,118.673,120.176,1.503

i am not tamed, i, tamed,122.898,123.718,0.82
oh i am sorry said the little prince, oh, prince,124.471,126.804,2.333
but after some thought he added what does that mean tame, but, tame,127.388,131.106,3.718
you are not from here said the fox, you, fox,131.799,133.528,1.729

what does tame mean, what, mean,138.787,140.646,1.859

it is very bothersome, it, bothersome,145.39,146.3,0.91
they also raise chickens, they, chickens,146.904,148.648,1.744
it is their sole interest, it, interest,148.942,150.037,1.095

that is right said the fox, that, fox,166.332,167.876,1.544
to me you are still only a little boy just like a hundred thousand other little boys, to, boys,168.18,173.06,4.88
and i do not need you and you do not need me either, and, either,173.06,175.957,2.897
to you i am only a fox just like a hundred thousand other foxes, to, foxes,176.58,180.344,3.764
but if you tame me we will need each other, but, other,181.022,183.491,2.469
to me you will be unique in the entire world, to, world,184.029,186.973,2.944
to you i will be unique in the entire world, to, world,187.377,189.986,2.609

there is a flower, there, flower,194.156,195.401,1.245
i think she has tamed me, i, me,195.401,196.695,1.294

my life is very monotonous, my, monotonous,226.707,228.402,1.695
I hunt chickens, i, chickens,228.821,229.785,0.964
men hunt me, men, me,230.01,230.74,0.73
all the chickens look alike and all the men look alike, all, alike,231.428,234.371,2.943
so i get a bit bored, so, bored,234.784,235.915,1.131
but if you tame me it would bring some sunlight into my life, but, life,236.474,240.442,3.968
i would come to know a sound of footsteps, i, footsteps,240.866,243.031,2.165
unlike any other other footsteps send me hurrying back underground yours would call me out of my burrow like music, unlike, music,243.031,251.06,8.029
and then look you see the wheat fields down there, and, there,251.364,254.352,2.988
i do not eat bread, i, bread,254.896,255.806,0.91
wheat is of no use to me, wheat, me,256.2,257.459,1.259
the wheat fields mean nothing to me and that is sad, the, sad,258.013,260.812,2.799
but your hair is the color of gold so it will be wonderful when you have tamed me, but, me,261.54,266.308,4.768
the wheat which is golden will remind me of you and i will love the sound of the wind blowing through the wheat, the, wheat,266.737,273.393,6.656
the fox went silent and gazed at the little prince for a long time, the, time,274.675,278.499,3.824
please tame me he said, please, said,279.232,281.74,2.508
i really want to the little prince replied, i, replied,282.678,285.092,2.414
but i do not have much time, but, time,285.092,287.115,2.023
i have friends to discover and many things to understand, i, understand,287.619,290.604,2.985
one only understands the things that one tames said the fox, one, fox,291.611,295.895,4.284
men no longer have the time to get to know anything, men, anything,296.239,299.323,3.084
they buy things ready made in the shops, they, shops,299.827,301.886,2.059
but as there are not any shops that sell friends men no longer have any friends, but, friends,302.469,306.873,4.404
if you want a friend tame me, if, me,307.671,309.815,2.144
what should i do asked the little prince, what, prince,311.002,313.275,2.273
you have to be very patient replied the fox, you, fox,314.178,316.921,2.743
first you will sit down a little way away from me like this in the grass, first, grass,317.355,321.414,4.059
i will watch you out of the corner of my eye and you will not say anything, i, anything,321.813,325.466,3.653
words are a source of misunderstandings, words, misunderstandings,325.979,328.069,2.09
but every day you will be able to sit a little closer, but, closer,328.558,331.686,3.128
the next day the little prince came back, the, back,333.028,335.002,1.974
it would have been better to come back at the same time of day said the fox, it, fox,335.915,339.838,3.923
if you come for example at four o clock in the afternoon from three o clock i would start to feel happy as the time got nearer, if, nearer,340.167,347.858,7.691
i would feel happier and happier already by four o clock, i, clock,347.858,351.591,3.733
i would be jumping about and getting restless, i, restless,351.591,353.85,2.259
i would come to learn the price of happiness, i, happiness,354.164,356.838,2.674
but if you come at just any time i would never know at what time my heart should be ready to greet you, but, you,357.506,362.454,4.948
we must observe the rites, we, rites,362.933,364.378,1.445
what is a rite asked the little prince, what, prince,365.34,367.499,2.159
they are also something too often forgotten said the fox, they, fox,368.557,372.06,3.503
they are what make one day different from other days one hour different from other hours, they, hours,372.733,378.081,5.348
there is a rite for example among my hunters, there, hunters,378.445,381.344,2.899
on thursdays they dance with the girls of the village so thursday is a wonderful day, on, day,381.828,387.29,5.462
i can go for a walk as far as the vineyards, i, vineyards,387.724,390.144,2.42
if the hunters danced on just any day all the days would be alike and i had never have any rest, if, rest,390.483,396.389,5.906
so the little prince tamed the fox, so, fox,397.597,399.821,2.224
and when the time to leave drew near oh said the fox i will cry, and, cry,400.295,405.85,5.555
it is your fault said the little prince, it, prince,406.579,409.024,2.445
i never wished you any harm but you wanted me to tame you, i, you,409.024,412.726,3.702
i know said the fox, i, fox,413.344,414.988,1.644
but you are going to cry said the little prince, but, prince,415.667,418.091,2.424
i know said the fox, i, fox,418.849,420.577,1.728
so all this has done you no good at all, so, all,421.011,423.591,2.58
it has done me good said the fox, it, fox,424.319,426.712,2.393
because of the color of the wheat, because, wheat,427.141,428.771,1.63
and then he added go and see the roses again, and, again,429.703,432.931,3.228
you will understand that yours is unique in the entire world, you, world,433.455,436.784,3.329
then come back to say goodbye to me and i will make you a present of a secret, then, secret,437.433,441.8,4.367
the little prince went away to see the roses again, the, again,443.432,445.916,2.484
you are not like my rose at all, you, all,446.929,448.644,1.715
you are nothing yet he told them, you, them,448.988,451.017,2.029
no one has tamed you and you have not tamed anyone, no, anyone,451.306,454.42,3.114
you are like my fox used to be, you, be,454.745,456.579,1.834
he was only a fox just like a hundred thousand others but i have made him my friend and now he is unique in the entire world, he, world,457.137,465.474,8.337
and the roses were very embarrassed, and, embarrassed,466.317,468.262,1.945
you are beautiful but you are empty he went on, you, on,469.03,472.268,3.238
one could not die for you, one, you,472.652,474.301,1.649
of course an ordinary passer by would think that my rose looked just like you, of, you,475.164,479.128,3.964
but she alone is more important than all of you because it is her that i watered, but, watered,479.647,485.14,5.493
because it is her that i put under the glass dome, because, dome,485.14,487.529,2.389
because it is her that i sheltered behind the screen, because, screen,488.012,490.532,2.52
because it is for her that i killed the caterpillars except two or three to become butterflies, because, butterflies,490.841,496.238,5.397
because it is her that i listened to grumble or boast or even sometimes when she said nothing, because, nothing,496.846,502.13,5.284
because she is my rose, because, rose,502.698,504.283,1.585
and he went back to the fox, and, fox,505.251,506.7,1.449
goodbye he said, goodbye, said,507.528,508.967,1.439
goodbye said the fox, goodbye, fox,509.745,511.338,1.593
here is my secret, here, secret,512.012,513.076,1.064
it is very simple, it, simple,513.41,514.295,0.885
one only sees clearly with the heart, one, heart,515.382,517.846,2.464
what is essential is invisible to the eye, what, eye,518.45,521.079,2.629
what is essential is invisible to the eye repeated the little prince so as to remember, what, remember,522.017,527.005,4.988
it is the time you have wasted on your rose that makes your rose so important, it, important,528.088,533.13,5.042
it is the time that i have wasted on my rose said the little prince so as to remember, it, remember,534.018,538.857,4.839
the men have forgotten this truth said the fox but you must not forget it, the, it,539.839,544.99,5.151
you become forever responsible for that which you have tamed, you, tamed,545.669,549.168,3.499
you are responsible for your rose, you, rose,549.796,552.031,2.235
i am responsible for my rose repeated the little prince so as to remember, i, remember,552.844,557.262,4.418
good morning said the little prince, good, prince,558.456,560.32,1.864
good morning said the railway switchman, good, switchman,560.919,562.993,2.074
what do you do here the little prince asked, what, asked,563.881,566.105,2.224
i sort travelers in packs of a thousand said the switchman, i, switchman,566.763,570.056,3.293
i dispatch the trains that carry them sometimes to the right sometimes to the left, i, left,570.575,574.763,4.188
and a brilliantly lit express train rumbling like thunder shook the switchman 's cabin, and, cabin,575.496,580.939,5.443
they really are in a hurry said the little prince, they, prince,581.807,584.486,2.679
what is it that they are looking for, what, for,585.19,586.584,1.394
not even the locomotive engineer knows that said the switchman, not, switchman,587.288,590.776,3.488
a second brilliantly lit express thundered by in the opposite direction, a, direction,591.514,595.683,4.169
are they back already asked the little prince, are, prince,596.526,599.014,2.488
these are not the same ones said the switchman, these, switchman,599.568,601.797,2.229
it is an exchange, it, exchange,602.156,603.211,1.055
were not they happy where they were, were, were,603.964,605.494,1.53
no one is ever happy where they are said the switchman, no, switchman,606.282,609.011,2.729
a third brilliantly lit express thundered by, a, by,609.884,612.648,2.764
are they chasing after the first travelers asked the little prince, are, prince,613.536,617.114,3.578
they are not chasing after anything at all said the switchman, they, switchman,617.838,620.786,2.948
they are asleep in there or if not they are yawning, they, yawning,621.12,623.814,2.694
only the children are Suashing their noses up against the windows, only, windows,624.363,627.682,3.319
only the children know what they are after said the little prince, only, prince,628.56,631.794,3.234
they waste their time with a rag doll and it becomes very important to them, they, them,632.093,636.411,4.318
and if someone takes it away from them they cry, and, cry,636.905,639.344,2.439
they are lucky said the switchman, they, switchman,640.103,641.896,1.793
good morning said the little prince, good, prince,0.015,1.874,1.859
good morning said the merchant, good, merchant,2.592,4.212,1.62
this was a merchant who sold pills that had been created to quench thirst, this, thirst,4.955,9.158,4.203
you could take one pill a week and you no longer felt the need to drink anything, you, anything,9.562,13.701,4.139
why are you selling those asked the little prince, why, prince,14.554,17.323,2.769
it is a big time saver said the merchant, it, merchant,17.826,20.39,2.564
experts have done calculations, experts, calculations,20.39,22.239,1.849
you save fifty three minutes per week, you, week,22.563,24.542,1.979
and what do i do with the fifty three minutes, and, minutes,25.515,27.744,2.229
you can do anything you like with them, you, them,28.402,29.762,1.36
myself the little prince said to himself if i had fifty three minutes to spend as i liked i would walk very slowly toward a spring of fresh water, myself, water,30.904,40.239,9.335
we were at the eighth day since my accident in the desert and i had listened to the story of the merchant as i drank the last drop of my water supply, we, supply,41.394,49.411,8.017
ah i said to the little prince these memories of yours are very charming, ah, charming,50.758,55.391,4.633
but i have not managed to repair my plane yet, but, yet,55.795,58.03,2.235
i have nothing left to drink and i too would be happy if i could walk slowly towards a spring of fresh water, i, water,58.523,64.99,6.467
my friend the fox he said to me, my, me,66.068,68.247,2.179
my dear fellow our situation has nothing to do with the fox anymore, my, anymore,68.81,72.914,4.104
why not, why, not,73.612,74.237,0.625
because we will die of thirst, because, thirst,74.915,76.575,1.66
he did not follow my reasoning and he answered me, he, me,77.358,79.912,2.554
it is nice to have had a friend even if you are about to die, it, die,80.591,83.715,3.124
myself i am glad to have had a fox as a friend, myself, friend,84.468,87.541,3.073
he never considers the danger i said to myself, he, myself,88.454,91.054,2.6
he has never been hungry or thirsty, he, thirsty,91.567,93.422,1.855
a little sunshine is all he needs, a, needs,93.816,95.696,1.88
but he looked at me and replied to my thought, but, thought,96.489,98.633,2.144
i am also thirsty, i, thirsty,99.152,100.222,1.07
let us look for a well, let, well,100.696,101.671,0.975
i made a gesture of weariness, i, weariness,102.624,104.393,1.769
it is absurd to look for a well at random in the immensity of the desert but we started walking anyway, it, anyway,104.633,111.039,6.406
when we had walked for hours in silence night fell and the stars began to come out, when, out,112.496,117.604,5.108
i saw them as if in a dream as my thirst had made me feverish, i, feverish,118.058,121.946,3.888
the little prince 's words danced in my memory, the, memory,122.869,125.419,2.55
so you are also thirsty i asked him, so, him,126.032,128.421,2.389
but he did not reply to my question, but, question,129.06,130.784,1.724
he said simply water can be good for the heart too, he, too,131.138,134.86,3.722
i did not understand his answer but i said nothing, i, nothing,135.813,138.822,3.009
i knew better than to press my questions, i, questions,139.346,141.465,2.119
he was tired, he, tired,142.283,142.963,0.68
he sat down, he, down,143.412,144.142,0.73
i sat down beside him and after a silence he spoke again, i, again,144.805,148.913,4.108
the stars are beautiful because of a flower that can not be seen, the, seen,150.18,153.499,3.319
i replied that is true, i, true,154.297,156.08,1.783
and i looked without saying anything at the folds of sand in the moonlight, and, moonlight,156.783,161.471,4.688
the desert is beautiful the little prince added, the, added,162.394,165.187,2.793
and it was true, and, true,166.03,166.82,0.79
i have always loved the desert, i, desert,167.174,168.683,1.509
you sit down on a sand dune, you, dune,169.581,171.151,1.57
you see nothing, you, nothing,171.52,172.33,0.81
you hear nothing and yet something radiates forth in the silence, you, silence,172.809,177.861,5.052
what makes the desert beautiful said the little prince is that somewhere it hides a well, what, well,179.088,184.909,5.821
i was surprised to suddenly understand this mysterious radiation of the sands, i, sands,186.486,191.26,4.774
when i was a little boy i lived in an old house and legend told that a treasure was buried there, when, there,192.407,198.4,5.993
of course no one had ever been able to find it or perhaps no one had even looked for it, of, it,198.824,204.181,5.357
but it cast an enchantment over that house, but, house,204.69,207.653,2.963
my home was hiding a secret in the depths of its heart, my, heart,208.107,211.521,3.414
yes i said to the little prince, yes, prince,212.369,214.398,2.029
whether the house the stars or the desert what gives them their beauty is something invisible, whether, invisible,215.181,220.673,5.492
i am glad he said that you agree with my fox, i, fox,221.765,224.784,3.019
as the little prince fell asleep i took him in my arms and set out walking again, as, again,226.36,230.954,4.594
i felt deeply moved, i, moved,231.657,233.141,1.484
it seemed to me that i was carrying a very fragile treasure, it, treasure,233.615,237.349,3.734
it even seemed to me that there was nothing more fragile on earth, it, earth,237.823,241.582,3.759
i looked in the moonlight at his pale forehead his closed eyes his locks of hair that trembled in the wind, i, wind,242.784,249.596,6.812
and i said to myself what i see here is only a shell, and, shell,250.095,254.088,3.993
that which is most important is invisible, that, invisible,254.701,256.986,2.285
as his slightly parted lips gave way to a half smile i continued what i find so deeply moving about this little sleeping prince is his devotion to a flower, as, flower,258.208,269.097,10.889
it is the image of a rose that shines in him like the flame of a lamp even when he is sleeping, it, sleeping,269.94,275.043,5.103
and i came to think of him as even more fragile, and, fragile,275.961,278.626,2.665
one has to look after lamps, one, lamps,279.953,281.747,1.794
a gust of wind can put them out, a, out,282.116,283.995,1.879
and continuing to walk i found the well at daybreak, and, daybreak,284.779,288.452,3.673
men said the little prince stuff themselves into express trains but they do not know what they are looking for, men, for,289.676,296.232,6.556
so they rush about and go in circles and he added it is not worth it, so, it,296.541,301.787,5.246
the well we had reached was not like the other wells of the sahara, the, sahara,303.369,306.728,3.359
the wells of the sahara are mere holes dug in the sand, the, sand,307.476,310.96,3.484
this one looked like a village well but there was no village there and i thought i was dreaming, this, dreaming,311.305,317.185,5.88
it is strange i said to the little prince, it, prince,318.158,320.482,2.324
everything has been prepared the pulley the bucket and the rope, everything, rope,320.896,324.349,3.453
he laughed took the rope and put the pulley to work, he, work,324.843,328.18,3.337
and the pulley moaned like an old weathervane when there has long been no wind, and, wind,328.748,333.337,4.589
can you hear that said the little prince, can, prince,334.165,336.369,2.204
we have woken up the well and it is singing, we, singing,336.658,338.887,2.229
i did not want him to tire himself out, i, out,339.73,341.76,2.03
let me do it i said, let, said,342.293,343.638,1.345
it is too heavy for you, it, you,343.962,344.952,0.99
i hoisted the bucket slowly to the edge of the well and set it down good and level, i, level,345.974,350.673,4.699
the song of the pulley continued in my ears and in the still trembling water i could see the sunlight shimmer, the, shimmer,351.276,358.064,6.788
i am thirsty for this water said the little prince, i, prince,359.041,361.67,2.629
give me some to drink, give, drink,362.189,363.259,1.07
and i knew then what he had been looking for, and, for,364.221,366.441,2.22
i raised the bucket to his lips, i, lips,367.134,369.193,2.059
he drank, he, drank,369.537,370.312,0.775
his eyes closed, his, closed,370.312,371.661,1.349
it was as sweet as some special festival treat, it, treat,372.015,375.134,3.119
this water was something very different from ordinary nourishment, this, nourishment,376.007,379.806,3.799
it was born of the walk under the stars of the song of the pulley of the effort of my arms, it, arms,380.3,385.787,5.487
it was good for the heart like a present, it, present,386.331,388.734,2.403
when i was a little boy the lights of the christmas tree the music of the midnight mass the tenderness in the smiles produced in a similar way the radiance of the gift that i received, when, received,389.548,401.231,11.683
the men where you live said the little prince grow five thousand roses in a single garden and they do not find what they are looking for in it, the, it,402.453,411.064,8.611
they do not find it i replied, they, replied,411.782,413.611,1.829
and yet what they are looking for could be found in a single rose or in a little water, and, water,414.199,419.686,5.487
that is true i said, that, said,420.525,421.934,1.409
and the little prince added but the eyes are blind, and, blind,422.762,426.005,3.243
you have to search with the heart, you, heart,426.289,427.923,1.634
i had drunk the water, i, water,429.29,430.44,1.15
i breathed easily, i, easily,430.968,432.068,1.1
the sand at sunrise is the color of honey, the, honey,432.717,435.281,2.564
this honey color was also making me feel good, this, good,435.82,438.949,3.129
why then did i have to have this sense of grief, why, grief,439.767,442.676,2.909
you have to keep your promise said the little prince softly who had again sat down beside me, you, me,443.828,449.56,5.732
what promise, what, promise,450.688,451.438,0.75
you know a muzzle for my sheep, you, sheep,452.051,454.235,2.184
i am responsible for this flower, i, flower,455.038,456.757,1.719
i took my sketches out of my pocket, i, pocket,458.129,460.223,2.094
the little prince saw them and laughed as he said your baobabs they look a bit like cabbages, the, cabbages,460.687,466.823,6.136
oh and i had been so proud of my baobabs, oh, baobabs,467.477,470.719,3.242
your fox his ears they look a bit like horns and they are too long, your, long,471.542,476.285,4.743
and then he laughed again, and, again,476.918,478.203,1.285
you are not being fair my little fellow, you, fellow,478.931,480.766,1.835
i do not know how to draw anything except boa constrictors closed and open, i, open,481.17,485.518,4.348
oh it will be ok he said, oh, said,486.441,488.34,1.899
children understand, children, understand,488.649,489.784,1.135
so i made a pencil sketch of a muzzle and i felt a pang in my heart as i gave it to him, so, him,490.881,496.344,5.463
you have plans that i do not know about, you, about,497.361,499.281,1.92
but he did not respond, but, respond,500.184,501.353,1.169
he said to me you know my descent to earth tomorrow will be its anniversary, he, anniversary,501.907,508.156,6.249
then after a silence he went on, then, on,509.358,511.343,1.985
i came down very near here, i, here,512.231,513.966,1.735
and he blushed, and, blushed,514.784,515.564,0.78
and once again without understanding why i felt a peculiar sense of sorrow one question occurred to me however, and, however,516.646,524.767,8.121
so it was not by chance that the morning i first met you a week ago, so, ago,525.58,529.869,4.289
you were out walking like that all alone a thousand miles from any inhabited region, you, region,530.298,535.556,5.258
you were going back to the place where you landed, you, landed,536.284,538.448,2.164
the little prince blushed again, the, again,539.546,541.2,1.654
and i added hesitantly perhaps because of the anniversary, and, anniversary,541.749,545.921,4.172
the little prince blushed once more, the, more,547.218,549.188,1.97
he never answered questions but when you blush that means yes, he, yes,549.752,553.96,4.208
does not it, does, it,553.96,554.509,0.549
oh i said to him, oh, him,555.566,556.921,1.355
i am worried, i, worried,557.385,558.08,0.695
but he responded now you must work, but, work,558.524,561.211,2.687
you must go back to your engine, you, engine,561.83,563.365,1.535
i will wait for you here, i, here,563.808,564.978,1.17
come back tomorrow evening, come, evening,565.382,566.722,1.34
but i was not reassured, but, reassured,567.71,568.994,1.284
i remembered the fox, i, fox,569.653,570.977,1.324
you run the risk of weeping a little if you allow yourself to be tamed, you, tamed,571.65,575.724,4.074
there was next to the well the ruin of an old stone wall, there, wall,0.39,4.554,4.164
when i came back from my work the next evening i saw from a distance my little prince sitting on top of it, when, it,5.462,11.699,6.237
his feet hanging down, his, down,12.023,13.418,1.395
and i heard him say do not you remember, and, remember,14.061,16.555,2.494
then this is not the exact spot, then, spot,16.555,18.968,2.413
another voice must have answered him because he replied yes yes it is the right day but this is not the right place, another, place,19.721,27.177,7.456
i continued my walk toward the wall, i, wall,28.409,30.389,1.98
i still did not see or hear anyone yet, i, yet,30.983,33.648,2.665
the little prince replied again that is right, the, right,33.648,36.584,2.936
you will see where my tracks begin in the sand, you, sand,36.928,39.073,2.145
you just have to wait there for me, you, me,39.472,41.256,1.784
i will be there tonight, i, tonight,41.59,42.675,1.085
i was twenty meters from the wall and i still saw nothing, i, nothing,43.703,47.212,3.509
the little prince spoke again after a pause, the, pause,48.005,50.344,2.339
do you have good poison, do, poison,51.037,52.412,1.375
are you sure you will not make me suffer too long, are, long,53.115,55.44,2.325
i froze, i, froze,56.347,57.047,0.7
my heart skipped a beat but i still did not understand, my, understand,57.591,61.268,3.677
now go away he said, now, said,62.266,64,1.734
i want to come down from here, i, here,64.469,65.844,1.375
i then lowered my eyes to the foot of the wall and i leapt up, i, up,67.021,70.939,3.918
right there facing the little prince was one of those yellow snakes that can kill you in thirty seconds flat, right, flat,71.403,78.311,6.908
even as i dug around in my pocket to take out my revolver i made a running step back, even, back,78.945,84.776,5.831
but at the noise i made the snake let himself flow easily across the sand like the dying spray of a fountain and in no apparent hurry slipped between the stones with a light metallic sound, but, sound,85.55,98.268,12.718
i reached the wall just in time to catch my little fellow in my arms who was white as snow, i, snow,99.136,104.504,5.368
what is going on here, what, here,105.297,106.197,0.9
why are you talking with snakes, why, snakes,106.397,108.181,1.784
i had loosened the golden muffler that he always wore, i, wore,109.149,111.863,2.714
i had moistened his temples and had him drink, i, drink,112.337,114.762,2.425
and now i did not dare ask him anything more, and, more,115.151,118.099,2.948
he looked at me gravely and put his arms around my neck, he, neck,118.932,121.871,2.939
i felt his heart beat like the heart of a dying bird when shot with a rifle, i, rifle,122.43,126.873,4.443
he said to me i am glad that you have found what was wrong with your engine, he, engine,127.487,131.27,3.783
now you will be able to go back home, now, home,131.738,133.448,1.71
how did you know, how, know,134.121,134.841,0.72
i was just coming to tell him that against all odds my work had been successful, i, successful,135.56,140.033,4.473
he made no answer to my question but he added i am also going back home today, he, today,140.866,146.098,5.232
then he said sadly it is a lot further, then, further,146.916,149.754,2.838
it is much more difficult, it, difficult,150.178,151.593,1.415
i felt very clearly that something extraordinary was happening, i, happening,152.855,156.374,3.519
i held him tightly in my arms like a small child, i, child,157.122,160.167,3.045
and yet it seemed to me that he was plummeting down into an abyss and that i could do nothing to restrain him, and, him,160.431,166.388,5.957
he had a serious look as if lost far away, he, away,167.586,170.705,3.119
i have your sheep and i have the box for the sheep and i have the muzzle, i, muzzle,171.637,176.479,4.842
and he smiled sadly, and, sadly,177.247,178.611,1.364
i waited a long while, i, while,179.734,181.214,1.48
i could feel that he was reviving little by little, i, little,181.807,184.417,2.61
my little fellow i said to him, my, him,185.28,187.134,1.854
you are afraid, you, afraid,187.628,188.442,0.814
he was afraid of course but he laughed softly, he, softly,189.32,192.353,3.033
i will be much more afraid this evening, i, evening,193.127,194.986,1.859
again i felt myself frozen by the sense of something irreparable and i knew that i could not bear the idea of never hearing that laughter again, again, again,195.989,205.919,9.93
for me it was like a spring of fresh water in the desert, for, desert,206.867,210.515,3.648
little fellow i said i want to hear you laugh again, little, again,211.638,215.31,3.672
but he said to me tonight it will be a year, but, year,216.223,219.236,3.013
my star will be right above the spot where i came down to earth a year ago, my, ago,219.819,223.918,4.099
little fellow is this all a bad dream this business with the snake and the meeting place and the star, little, star,225.03,231.072,6.042
but he did not answer my question, but, question,231.995,233.53,1.535
he said to me that which is important can not be seen, he, seen,234.442,238.329,3.887
i know, i, know,239.137,239.567,0.43
it is like with the flower, it, flower,240.47,241.765,1.295
if you love a flower that is on a star it is sweet to look at the sky at night, if, night,242.288,246.961,4.673
all the stars are covered with flowers, all, flowers,247.54,249.644,2.104
i know, i, know,250.502,250.923,0.421
it is like with the water, it, water,251.756,252.99,1.234
the water you gave me to drink was like music because of the pulley and the rope, the, rope,253.324,257.932,4.608
you remember, you, remember,258.451,259.161,0.71
it was good, it, good,259.724,260.354,0.63
i know, i, know,261.347,261.807,0.46
at night you will look at the stars, at, stars,262.859,264.574,1.715
where i live everything is too small for me to point out to you where my star is, where, is,264.903,269.816,4.913
it is better like that, it, that,270.295,271.454,1.159
my star will be for you just one of the stars, my, stars,271.843,274.927,3.084
so you will love to look at all of the stars, so, stars,275.446,277.68,2.234
they will all be your friends, they, friends,278.124,279.409,1.285
and besides i am going to make you a present, and, present,279.897,282.721,2.824
he laughed again, he, again,283.524,284.528,1.004
ah little fellow dear little fellow i love to hear that laugh, ah, laugh,285.451,289.694,4.243
that is my present, that, present,290.647,291.721,1.074
just that it will be like with the water, just, water,292.16,295.058,2.898
what are you trying to say, what, say,296.11,297.22,1.11
everyone has the same stars but they are not the same to everyone, everyone, everyone,298.487,302.89,4.403
for some who are travelers the stars are guides, for, guides,303.773,306.877,3.104
for others they are nothing but little lights, for, lights,307.471,310.149,2.678
for others who are scholars they are problems, for, problems,310.942,313.337,2.395
for my businessman they were wealth, for, wealth,313.841,315.705,1.864
but none of these stars say anything back, but, back,316.464,318.908,2.444
you will have the stars as no one else has them, you, them,319.966,322.87,2.904
what are you trying to say, what, say,323.883,324.978,1.095
when you look at the sky at night because i will be living on one of them because i will be laughing on one of them for you it will be like all the stars are laughing, when, laughing,326.504,337.003,10.499
you only you will have stars that can laugh, you, laugh,337.597,341.464,3.867
and he laughed again, and, again,342.307,343.477,1.17
and when your sorrow is comforted time heals all wounds you will be glad to have known me, and, me,344.774,350.421,5.647
you will always be my friend, you, friend,351.139,352.574,1.435
you will want to laugh with me, you, me,352.988,354.562,1.574
and sometimes you will open your window just like that for fun, and, fun,355.041,358.824,3.783
and your friends will be very surprised to see you laughing whilst watching the sky, and, sky,359.348,363.822,4.474
so you will tell them yes the stars always make me laugh and they will think you are crazy, so, crazy,364.585,370.591,6.006
i will have played a dirty trick on you, i, you,371.085,372.969,1.884
and he laughed again, and, again,373.767,374.877,1.11
it will be as if i would given you instead of stars lots and lots of little bells that can laugh, it, laugh,375.925,381.757,5.832
and he laughed some more, and, more,382.411,383.66,1.249
then he suddenly became serious again, then, again,384.918,387.332,2.414
tonight you know do not come, tonight, come,388.45,391.391,2.941
i will not leave you, i, you,392.399,393.233,0.834
it will look as if i am suffering, it, suffering,394.326,396.07,1.744
it will look a bit as if i am dying, it, dying,396.684,398.503,1.819
it is like that, it, that,398.937,399.807,0.87
do not come to see that, do, that,400.455,401.73,1.275
it is not worth it, it, it,402.014,402.989,0.975
i will not leave you, i, you,403.991,404.926,0.935
but he was worried, but, worried,405.909,406.779,0.87
i am telling you this it is also because of the snake, i, snake,407.771,411.01,3.239
he must not bite you, he, you,411.459,412.848,1.389
snakes are mean, snakes, mean,413.467,414.492,1.025
they can bite you just for fun, they, fun,414.896,416.57,1.674
i will not leave you, i, you,417.653,418.713,1.06
but something reassured him, but, him,419.715,421.18,1.465
it is true that they have no poison left for a second bite, it, bite,422.442,425.721,3.279
that night i did not see him set out, that, out,426.679,429.043,2.364
he got away without making a sound, he, sound,429.577,431.491,1.914
when i managed to catch him up he was walking along determinedly at a brisk pace, when, pace,432.359,437.462,5.103
he said to me only oh you came, he, came,438.15,441.258,3.108
and he took me by the hand but he was still worrying, and, worrying,442.066,445.294,3.228
you have made a mistake, you, mistake,446.576,447.605,1.029
you will suffer, you, suffer,448.049,448.699,0.65
it will look as if i am dead and that will not be true, it, true,449.183,452.032,2.849
i said nothing, i, nothing,452.895,453.704,0.809
you understand it is too far, you, far,454.717,456.95,2.233
i can not carry this body with me, i, me,457.509,459.324,1.815
it is too heavy, it, heavy,459.324,460.208,0.884
i said nothing, i, nothing,461.391,462.205,0.814
but it will be like an old abandoned shell, but, shell,463.722,465.987,2.265
there is nothing sad about old shells, there, shells,466.46,468.555,2.095
i said nothing, i, nothing,469.702,470.492,0.79
he got a bit discouraged but he made one more effort, he, effort,471.54,474.728,3.188
you know it will be nice, you, nice,475.511,477.41,1.899
i will also look at the stars, i, stars,478.044,479.688,1.644
all the stars will be wells with a rusty pulley, all, pulley,480.262,483.131,2.869
all the stars will pour out fresh water for me to drink, all, drink,483.49,486.849,3.359
i said nothing, i, nothing,488.106,488.981,0.875
it will be so much fun, it, fun,490.143,491.478,1.335
you will have five hundred million little bells and i will have five hundred million springs of fresh water, you, water,492.077,498.42,6.343
and then he too was silent because he was crying, and, crying,499.727,502.721,2.994
here is the place, here, place,504.138,504.917,0.779
let me go on by myself, let, myself,505.586,507.076,1.49
and he sat down because he was afraid, and, afraid,507.983,509.998,2.015
he said you know my flower i am responsible for her, he, her,510.896,515.651,4.755
and she is so weak, and, weak,516.239,517.404,1.165
and she is so naive, and, naive,517.858,519.148,1.29
she has four thorns of no use at all to protect herself against the entire world, she, world,519.946,525.424,5.478
i sat down too because i was no longer able to stand, i, stand,526.76,530.479,3.719
he said that is everything, he, everything,531.551,534.897,3.346
he hesitated a bit and then stood back up, he, up,536.214,539.017,2.803
he took one step, he, step,539.954,540.984,1.03
i could not move, i, move,541.702,542.612,0.91
there was nothing but a yellow flash close to his ankle, there, ankle,543.629,546.859,3.23
he remained motionless for an instant, he, instant,547.667,550.016,2.349
he did not cry out, he, out,550.645,551.779,1.134
he fell as gently as a tree falls, he, falls,552.503,554.832,2.329
there was not even any sound because of the sand, there, sand,555.466,558.325,2.859
and now of course it has already been six years, and, years,559.565,562.669,3.104
i have never yet told this story, i, story,563.222,565.242,2.02
the companions who met me were very happy to see me alive again, the, again,566.08,569.534,3.454
i was sad but i told them it is because i am tired, i, tired,570.193,573.386,3.193
now my sorrow is comforted a little, now, little,574.638,576.798,2.16
i mean not entirely but i do know that he got back to his planet because at daybreak i did not find his body, i, body,577.192,584.742,7.55
it was not a very heavy body, it, body,585.654,587.344,1.69
and i love to listen to the stars at night, and, night,587.918,590.192,2.274
it is just like five hundred million little bells, it, bells,590.811,593.775,2.964
but there is one extraordinary thing, but, thing,594.818,597.032,2.214
when i drew the muzzle for the little prince i forgot to add the leather strap to it, when, it,597.9,602.862,4.962
he would never have been able to fasten it to the sheep, he, sheep,603.471,606.09,2.619
so i wonder what happened on his planet, so, planet,606.663,609.412,2.749
it may well be the sheep ate the flower, it, flower,610.13,612.199,2.069
sometimes i tell myself surely not the little prince shuts his flower under her glass dome every night and he watches over his sheep very carefully, sometimes, carefully,613.227,622.532,9.305
then i am happy and all the stars laugh sweetly, then, sweetly,623.101,626.279,3.178
other times i tell myself everyone is absent minded at some point and that is all it takes, other, takes,627.192,633.124,5.932
one evening he would have forgotten the glass dome or maybe the sheep got out quietly during the night, one, night,633.398,639.4,6.002
and then the little bells turn to tears, and, tears,640.178,642.578,2.4
herein lies a great mystery for you who also love the little prince just like for me, herein, me,643.795,650.006,6.211
nothing in the universe is the same if somewhere out there a sheep that we have never seen has has it eaten a rose, nothing, rose,650.505,659.903,9.398
look at the sky, look, sky,661.091,661.91,0.819
ask yourselves has the sheep yes or no eaten the flower, ask, flower,662.574,667.315,4.741
and you will see how everything changes, and, changes,668.218,670.248,2.03
and no grownup will ever understand that this is a matter of such importance, and, importance,670.966,675.834,4.868
this to me is the most beautiful and most sad landscape in the world, this, world,677.58,682.468,4.888
it is the same landscape as the one on the previous page, it, page,683.251,686.306,3.055
but i have drawn it again to show it to you properly, but, properly,686.884,689.369,2.485
it is here that the little prince appeared on earth and then disappeared, it, disappeared,690.137,694.299,4.162
look at this landscape carefully so as to be sure to recognize it if one day you travel in africa in the desert, look, desert,695.232,702.663,7.431
and if you happen to pass by there i beg you do not hurry on, and, on,703.227,707.704,4.477
wait a while exactly under the star, wait, star,708.243,710.407,2.164
if a child then comes to you if he laughs if he has golden hair if he does not respond when questioned you will easily guess who it is, if, is,711.125,720.859,9.734
so think of me, so, me,721.418,722.238,0.82
save me from this sorrow, save, sorrow,722.767,724.177,1.41
write to me quickly to tell me he is back, write, back,724.7,727.034,2.334
